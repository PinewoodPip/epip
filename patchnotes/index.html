<p class="admonition-title">Standalone usage warning</p>
<p><strong>If you have the Improved Hotbar mod, you must disable it to use Epip</strong>. All of its functions are already in Epip (+ like 9 months worth of updates that the workshop mod never got). See the <a href="../">front page</a> and the <a href="./">changelog</a> if you're new to Epip.</p>
</div>
<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NLEjkgnKlc6r4dDZw_AUHT1cdXVKhTmL/view?usp=sharing">Download here</a>.</p>
<p>With this version, EE has been removed as a dependency. It's now possible to use Epip in a non-EE playthrough and the main features will work. There may be quirks that need ironing out, ex. references to features or settings that only make sense in EE - please report these.</p>
<p>This also means that the remaining gameplay changes have been removed. If you wish to keep them, use <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HqxEzlXaZa4AMRpCybDPvZ2IyFjAL0J0/view?usp=sharing">this mod</a>.</p>
<p>The following patchnotes are the merged patchnotes of all beta versions of the patch, excluding the April Fools one.</p>
<p>By the way, due to logistics changes, you will have to re-enable immersive meditation in the settings, if you had it on.</p>
<ul>
<li>Animation cancelling now has 2 modes: client-side (v1065 behaviour) and server-side (old behaviour). The server-side option uses the lower delay that was used previously.</li>
<li>Changed how hotbar row count and visibility is saved<ul>
<li>This might not work in multiplayer due to extender shenanigans</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Custom status UI elements are now bigger (ex. in Quick Examine)</li>
<li>Added a new rune crafting system; simply right-click a rune material and select the new option in the dropdown menu to get started.</li>
<li>Reworked the stats tab; should be less prone to bugging out in multiplayer now<ul>
<li>Also fixed the gold &amp; splinter stat</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The incompatible mods warnings now show on every load, rather than once per playthrough</li>
<li>Updated localizations and added Brazilian Portuguese, translated by Ferocidade</li>
<li>Character sheet skew during anniversaries is now less extreme</li>

</ul>
<p>Fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed some log spam related to status icons</li>
<li>Fixed hotbar loadouts not working</li>
<li>Non-english languages should no longer have broken artifact descriptions<ul>
<li>The cause was fetching the TSKs during module load, which causes a bug that overwrites the string.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed Quick Examine not being openable for the same character twice in a row</li>
<li>Fixed vanity dyes not applying to slots that vanilla armor (without transmog) would hide/mask</li>
<li>Fixed error if an item was transmogged into a template that no longer existed</li>
<li>Fixed a typo in the settings to fix Astrologer's Gaze tooltip</li>
</ul>
<p>On the technical side of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added <code>ActionReleased</code> event to Input library</li>
<li>Added <code>GetIcon()</code> to BatteredHarried library</li>
<li>Added <code>GetLevelID()</code> to Entity library</li>
<li>Largely decoupled the logic for custom keybinds away from the UI itself (onto InputLib)</li>
<li>Added <code>EpicEncounters.DeltaMods</code> library with dynamically-generated data about EE deltamods</li>
<li>Added DragDropStateChanged event to Pointer lib</li>
<li>Equipped artifacts are now tracked using UserVars instead of tags</li>
<li>Generic:<ul>
<li>Added <code>RepositionElements()</code> to Grid</li>
<li>Added <code>Destroy()</code> to UI instances</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixes and additions to PlayerInfo methods</li>
<li>Moved various functionality from Feature up to its parent class Library (UserVars, ModVars)</li>
<li>Fixed some warning spam related to status icons</li>
<li>Various new checks to disable EE features when playing vanilla</li>
<li>Fixed setting ID conflict issues in the settings menu</li>
<li>Various fixes to debug cheats</li>
<li>Reworked the doc generation script again; the doc appearance has changed considerably, and now supports hotlinking to functions</li>
<li>Added support for multiple inheritance to classes made with the OOP library</li>

<p>Requires extender v58+.</p>
<p>Quick Examine improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added display for AP, SP, and initiative</li>
<li>Added resistances display</li>
<li>Added numerous settings: opacity, width/height, hiding certain widgets. You can find them in a new tab in the settings menu</li>
<li>Minor graphical touch-ups</li>
<li>Added a setting to set the default position of the UI; this position will be used after reloading</li>
<li>Added a statuses bar (toggleable)</li>
<li>Added a light stroke to the resistances text</li>
<li>Added a B/H display, with buffered damage towards the next stack</li>
<li>Now shows your ally's skills and their cooldowns<ul>
<li>Tooltips will show the damage as if they were used by them, but Epip features (like viewing which source infusions are available) likely do not work properly currently</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Quick Examine UI." src="../img/showcase/quick_examine.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Reworked the settings menu and underlying system<ul>
<li>Your previous setting values will be lost</li>
<li>The settings menu is now separate from the vanilla UI, prevent conflicts with mods that may overwrite the vanilla one</li>
<li>Settings have been reorganized into separate tabs</li>
<li>Settings are now saved per-profile, in <code>Osiris Data/Epip/{profile GUID}/</code></li>
<li>In the settings menu, the current tab's button is now highlighted (replicating vanilla behaviour)</li>
<li>Reworked the settings menu to be more easily expandable and changed the appearance of settings<ul>
<li>Tabs with a large amount of options (ex. Epic Enemies) might suffer stutters while opening them, similar to Quick Find. This is an issue with the UI framework that will be investigated later.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="New settings UI." src="../img/showcase/settings.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Added a new UI that shows a filtered view of the party inventory<ul>
<li>Opened with Ctrl+F by default (configurable in input menu)</li>
<li>Can filter equipment by slot, consumables by scrolls/grenades/potions, and skillbooks by school</li>
<li>Weapons and armor can be filtered by type (ex. sword, leather armor...)</li>
<li>Equipment can be searched by their stat boosts (supports only vanilla modifiers for now)</li>
<li>Right-click an equipped item to open the UI with filters set to that item's slot, to quickly replace gear</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Quick Find UI." src="../img/showcase/quick_find.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Vanity internals have been reworked, with multiple changes as a result:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dyes no longer require deltamods and thus should no longer be lost to shenanigans or bloat the savefile</li>
<li>Transmogrifying no longer requires the item to be transformed and therefore should no longer have any gameplay side effects<ul>
<li>As a result, you are no longer prevented from transmogrifying GB5 sets</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Transmogrifying weapons into another type (ex. dagger -&gt; bow) will have them show in the proper location while sheathed</li>
<li>Added an option to keep the icon while transmogrifying</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with dyes not being loaded properly from oufits</li>
<li>Added an option to hide any armor slot's visuals<ul>
<li>Due to an engine quirk, changing visibility is not properly reflected in the character sheet until you switch characters</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Removed support for vanity dyes from before v1063; items still using them will appear purple</li>
<li>Added an "Auras" tab to Vanity, where you can apply visual effects to your character, onto various bones</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added an option for animation-cancelling for player characters</p>
<ul>
<li>A new setting exists to blacklist skills from being affected. A more user-friendly way of adding entries will be added in a future version</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added a setting that controls how character level is displayed in the health bar; defaults to current behaviour (below bar, when holding shift). Includes the option to hide the level entirely.</li>
<li>Reworked the "show minimap" setting; should be more reliable now</li>
<li>You can now drag + drop items onto the Greatforge socket</li>
<li>"Status effects" in the vanilla examine UI is now capitalized, for consistency with the rest of the headers</li>
<li>Began removing gameplay changes from original versions of Epip. Since the focus of the mod has changed over to UI and QoL, gameplay changes no longer make sense within the project, and impede it from being used without EE.<ul>
<li>Removed changes to Battle Stomp, Bless, Circle of Protection, Escapist, Siphon Poison, Summon Soul Wolf, Wolf Howl, Break the Shackles</li>
<li>Removed changes to Elementalist damage</li>
<li>Removed changes to Leper</li>
<li>Reverted stat changes to Boneshaped Crusher and Soul Wolf</li>
<li>Removed Sight and Hearing FlexStat entries</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Clicking a status on a player portrait or Quick Examine will now center the camera on the status's source (if any)</li>
<li>"Copy identifier" keybind no longer copies template GUID</li>
<li>Added Russian translation by Cathe &amp; JoienReid<ul>
<li>Currently only spans the settings menu and some vanity features</li>
<li>Since playing in non-English currently has certain issues with add-ons, a new setting has been added to display text from Epip in a language different than the game's.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Level-up progress in character sheet is now shown with a percentage</li>
<li>Added settings for disabling most of the tooltip adjustments Epip offers</li>
<li>Surface tooltips should be more reliable</li>
<li>Combat log improvements are now enabled by default</li>
<li>Enemy health bar now uses a vanilla-ish appearance if EE is disabled (no fancy gargoyle boss frame)</li>
<li>B/H indicators in player portraits are now only shown in combat (instead of when unsheathed) and are disabled if EE is disabled</li>
<li>Removed the meme loading screen option</li>
<li>Skill tooltips for zone-type skills no longer erroneously say their range is increased by Astrologer's Gaze</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixes:</p>
<ul>

<li>Fixed layouts being saved for summons and party followers</li>
<li>Layouts should now be synchronized better in multiplayer, and survive a lua reset</li>
<li>Layouts now save when the pause menu is opened, rather than when the game is paused (which basically never happens in multiplayer)<ul>

<li>Support for this within Epip will be added throughout future updates; currently only some camera settings support this</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed weapon range deltamods only considering the first deltamod of that kind found<ul>
<li>This same fix is applied for weapon elemental damage mods as well</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On the technical side of things:</p>
<ul>

</ul>

<li>Searching saves is now case-insensitive</li>
<li>

<p>Fixed "Show empty containers/bodies" not actually working on items</p>
</li>
<li>Fixed another case of an infinite loop of switching characters</li>

<ul>
<li>Added an option to enable improvements to the combat log. Messages can be filtered by type, and certain messages will be merged into one line if they occur one after another, such as surface damage and healing. <strong>This option will only work when playing in english</strong>, unless someone is willing to help me make string patterns for other languages.<ul>
<li>Right-click the combat log to set your filters. You can also clear the log from that menu.</li>
<li>When damage messages are merged into one line, they will display the amount of hits that were merged at the end. The exception to this is damage that occurs within 25ms of eachother, such as weapon attacks with coatings. These are counted as a single hit.</li>

<li>Added some sick ASCII signatures to the bootstrap scripts, as well as a readme</li>
</ul>

<li>Added a <code>Text</code> library with a handy format function</li>
<li>Improvements to events and hooks: libraries can now hold their events and hooks as tables in <code>Event</code> and <code>Hooks</code> fields respectively, from which you can easily see all listener types available and register listeners. Doing it this way enables auto-completion and intellisense/EmmyLua annotations for listener parameters, which was not possible before. Old libraries will slowly be updated to use this, and the old method of registering listeners will stay.</li>
</ul>
<p>The standalone hotbar mod will be updated tomorrow (15th May).</p>

<p>As of today, Epip is now one year old! My attention span for projects tends to be very low (as evidenced by my other EE stuff), but Epip looks to be an exception to that and it's incredible what it has become - all its UI changes were nearly unimaginable just a year ago. Thank you all for the support throughout the months, even at times when the patches were a buggy mess.</p>
<p>Just like the initial release of the mod on April 1st, this anniversary patch is very real, and best experienced on this day of the month.</p>
<p>Changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pressing escape while in the EE UIs now backs out of them rather than bring up the pause menu</li>
<li>The stats tab now shows damage dealt and received in the current fight (or previous fight, when out of combat)</li>
<li>Added a new bug to the character sheet</li>
<li>Performance improvements to the hotbar</li>
<li>Gold/Splinter counter in the stats tab should now be more reliable</li>
<li>Minor technical changes to make the mod compatible with Descent</li>
<li>Added a scrollbar to the hotbar buttons drawer</li>
<li>The hotbar now goes below the inventory and character sheet</li>
<li>Hotbar cooldown animations should now be smoother</li>
<li>Fixed bugs with unbinding actions in the hotbar, as well as clearing unmemorized slots</li>
<li>Fixed muted characters not having their slots greyed out in hotbar</li>
<li>You can now activate your Epip Encounters license ingame from the options menu</li>
<li>Tooltips can now be scrolled on one axis with the mouse wheel</li>
<li>The punisher now drops MicroBoss™ loot to make him feel more optional</li>
<li>Added a cinematic camera option, on by default</li>
<li>Reworked the vanity feature: it now opens a custom tab in your character sheet. Browsing templates is a lot more convenient this way. Saved outfits are now categorized by race &amp; gender (doesn't stop you from applying them to anyone though)<ul>
<li>It wouldn't be an Epip patch if something didn't ship unfinished, which is why I must announce that the promised feature to mark templates as favorite did not make it in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="New transmog menu." src="../img/transmog.png" /></p>
<p><strong>On the technical side of things:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added an alias for the <code>Ext</code> table to make it easier to type:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-lua">SEX = Ext -- Short for &quot;Script EXtender&quot;
SEX.Print(&quot;Welcome to Norbyte's SEX v56 !&quot;)
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Fixed more inconsistencies with copy/paste in the message boxes</li>
<li>Added an option to log AI scoring to the console: the top 3 actions will be shown anytime decisions are made. Work-in-progress as some of the AI features in the extender are currently bugged.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="AI Logging." src="../img/ai.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Tooltips for Ascension stats in the stats tab are now created dynamically, so there's no need to edit them if you've edited the description/name</li>
<li>Added a <code>Server</code> table on the client, from which listeners for any Osiris symbol can be created, eliminating the need for boilerplate code on the server side if you need to listen for Osiris stuff.</li>
<li>Added an <code>Osiris</code> table on server to make user queries and DB queries a bit less aids to use in lua:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- DBs with only one tuple return their contents directly, rather than as a list
local _, value = Osiris.DB_PIP_EpicStats_DamageDealt(char.MyGuid, nil)

-- User queries can also return variables directly from their output DBs, even for queries with multiple outputs
local value = Osiris.QRY_AMER_KeywordStat_VitalityVoid_GetRadius(char.MyGuid, 1)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>On the future side of things:</strong></p>
<p>Development has slowed down throughout March due to work and studies, but I'm not planning on stopping work on Epip anytime soon, and there are lots of exciting features in the planning stages. There is no time estimate for any of them, they're just things I know I will try out <em>eventually</em>. I know creating expectations never ends up well, but for the anniversary I felt it would be nice to write down the ideas I'm planning for the near future:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Character sheet overhaul:</strong> the attribute/ability/talent tabs will become easily moddable, for modifying or adding new entries to them. This will pave the way for custom attributes and abilities. The UI currently used for the custom vanity tab will be made generic, so anyone can add their own tabs.</li>
<li><strong>Proper controller support for EE UIs:</strong> a large undertaking, but something that looks to be very possible and would be a massive quality of life improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Custom journal UI:</strong> will replace the current changelog functionality. The plan is to use the GM mode's journal UI as a base, since it's a slick, full-screen UI with support for nested categories. The functionality will be made generic, you'd be able to use it for more than just changelogs.</li>
<li><strong>A way to create UIs just from lua:</strong> work on this already started back in early January; it's used for the [REDACTED] in Fort Joy, but it's quite incomplete. The plan is to allow for creation of UIs with backgrounds, text, and all the Larian form elements (buttons, dropdowns, sliders etc.), all without touching any swf.</li>
<li>More documentation for the source code, namely the remaining UI scripts and the base metatables</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for reading and I hope you have an epic 1st of April.</p>
<h3 id="19222-huge-hotbar-rewrite">19/2/22 Huge Hotbar rewrite<a class="headerlink" href="#19222-huge-hotbar-rewrite" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Rewrote the hotbar UI. This involves mostly technical changes, in preparations for a standalone release.</p>
<p><strong>Your hotkey keybindings will be reset with this update! Please bind them again.</strong></p>
<p>Visible changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the top of the buttons area blocking clicks onto the world and other UIs</li>
<li>Any skill or item can now be dragged from the hotbar to the customizable buttons to bind it there (useful for old mods that use skills/items to bring up menus)<ul>
<li>The "use last slot" action has been removed due to this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Removed the "view changelog" action</li>
<li>The slot rendering is now entirely scripted (no help from the engine) which works around a crash and removes the need for an initialization procedure (that annoying "switch to the first row" message)</li>
<li>Saving your current amount of bars and order should be a lot more reliable (now happens upon pausing the game, instead of a timer)</li>
<li>Action buttons can now be highlighted or disabled; ex. the pyramids one is disabled if the party has no pyramids</li>
<li>Added an action to open the pyramids UI</li>
<li>Fixed the source skill border clipping into other rows</li>
<li>Added compatibility for Weapon Expansion: adds an action for toggling the menu, and repositions the original button when you have 2 rows of action buttons</li>
<li>Actions in the drawer are now ordered in a consistent manner</li>
<li>Added a context menu when you right click a row; from there, you can:<ul>
<li>"Push" groups of slots to the left/right (useful for inserting skills inbetween slots)</li>
<li>Clear rows, or unmemorized skills</li>
<li>Save and load "loadouts" of rows. Loadouts can be applied even if your character doesn't currently know all the skills from it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple tooltips (the ones that go in that very small black box) now appear much faster, rather than being delayed</li>
<li>Added numerous calls to <code>Game.Character</code> and <code>Game.Item</code>, mostly related to functionality needed for the hotbar.</li>
</ul>

<li>Keyboard hotkeys remain functional at all times, even if the buttons are hidden</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed "c" displaying on the hotbar button you're dragging</li>
<li>DoT statuses now show their calculated damage<ul>
<li>The display fluctuates for a bit after a skill cast, might redo this entirely later to not rely on the engine damage formula</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Centurion Battlestomp can now only be cast if the target is at &lt;10m, and does not consume the ranged charge</li>
<li>Tried banishing the "Enemy Turn" message again</li>
</ul>

<p>This patch contains numerous fixes and the first part of the rework of hotbar hotkeys. Happy birthday Derpy!</p>
<ul>
<li>Replaced the tutorials tab in the journal with a patch notes tab<ul>
<li>See EpipPatchNotes.lua for an example on how to use this in your own mod.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Artifact tooltips now show "Artifact" as rarity rather than Unique</li>
</ul>
<p>Hotbar Updates</p>
<ul>
<li>Added customizable hotbar action hotkeys/buttons. Drag and drop to rearrange/assign them, right click to bring up a list of all actions. Mods can add their own actions very easily; see HotbarActions.lua for an example.</li>
<li>To use them with keyboard keys, assign the "Hotbar Hotkey #" keys from the game's controls menu. Rebinding them will be easier in the future. You must also enable them within the config file.</li>
<li>This rework is a work-in-progress, both in terms of functionality and art; in the future there will also be a 1-row layout.</li>
<li>The multihotbar is now enabled by default. Set "disableHotbar" to true in the config file to disable it. (the old setting now does nothing)</li>
<li>Deprecated the Infusion and Meditate hotkeys; please use the hotbar version of them from now on.</li>
<li>Summons can no longer add hotbar rows</li>
<li>All the custom elements should now hide during dialogues</li>
<li>Fixed jankiness when using low resolutions</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixes</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed player status bar sometimes clipping through portraits and appearing to the left of them</li>
<li>Fixed stat adjustments tooltip not working properly on resists</li>
<li>Fixed stat adjustments tooltip eating up all other boosts</li>
<li>Fixed boss frame in the enemy health bar UI. It should work consistently now</li>
<li>Leper rune now should properly grant the talent when it's socketed into an equipped item</li>
<li>Fixed being able to infuse out-of-turn with the hotkey (rest in peace gigabrain infused reaction builds)</li>
<li>Possibly disabled turn notifications on the hotbar health bar</li>
</ul>
<p>Known issues</p>
<ul>
<li>"Actions" drawer (attack/sneak/sheathe) does not work well along with the default keyboard hotkey, and the menu is not repositioned</li>
<li>Buttons on the hotbar don't yet light up like they do in vanilla</li>
<li>Order of actions in drawer is random</li>
<li>Some hotbar buttons do not have state animations yet</li>
<li>The title in the patch notes menu will not be the right color the first time after a reload</li>
</ul>

<p>Many UI quality-of-life changes, as well as features for modders. The UI changes were untested on controllers. Most will not apply (status wrapping works, but reverts the frames to the square ones).</p>
<ul>
<li>The character sheet now displays physical and piercing resistances</li>
<li>The health bar when you hover over an enemy now shows B/H, with the icons lighting up when you have enough stacks for a T3. If you hold shift, the resistance display is replaced by AP, SP and Initiative info. Special thanks to Elric for the new art assets!</li>
<li>
<p>The B/H statuses are now hidden in that UI, to reduce clutter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added hotkeys for Meditate, Source Infusion and toggling additional hotbars. You can bind them from the game's normal controls screen. The hotbar hotkey allows you to temporarily toggle the additional bars from the multibar feature, explained below.</p>
</li>
<li>You can dismantle non-uniques from your inventory by right-clicking them and selecting the new Dismantle option at the bottom (work-in-progress, can get ‘stuck' sometimes; simply use it again on another item and both should be dismantled)</li>
<li>Presets in character creation now support descriptions (see the modding section on how to add these; Derpy's mod soon will)</li>
<li>"Stat Adjustments" in tooltips are merged into one line</li>
<li>Skill and item tooltips now reflect the +1ap costs from Slowed III (using items is still bugged; I'm pretty sure that's en engine issue)</li>
<li>The health bars at the bottom now always show their values (no need to hover)</li>
<li>Added a new stats tab in the character sheet with EE-related stats, like reaction charges and missing regeneration. Will also show your keyword activators and mutators. You can expand/collapse the stat tabs by left-clicking them.</li>
<li>The player portraits on the left now wrap their status displays onto a second row once a character has &gt;6 statuses. Each row tries to maintain an equal amount of statuses (they never wrap onto a third row).</li>
<li>Unfortunately, to make this work I had to hide summon statuses there. You can still see them in the middle of the screen or on the tooltip of their portrait. I might be able to remedy this in the future, it just needs more research.</li>
<li>
<p>Summon portraits will be shrunk once the player's statuses wrap.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can disable this in the config file.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a work-progress multihotbar; you must enable it from the config file in  Documents\Larian Studios\Divinity Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition\Osiris Data\Config_EpipEncounters.json (it will be generated on first load). I don't promise any stability at the moment. Multiplayer is untested.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can add up to 4 extra bars, and reorder them. Multihotbar layouts are synchronized to the host (savegame) every 8 mins.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The first time you load a save with the setting active, you will have to manually switch all characters to the first hotbar row before the multihotbar will be enabled. This is to circumvent a crash. You will only need to do this once per playthrough (and anytime you disable and re-enable the feature)</li>
<li>If the extra rows get in the way, remember there is a hotkey to temporarily toggle them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Known issues with the multihotbar:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resizing window does not update the health bar position properly, neither the bars<ul>
<li>The extra rows will not show icons if your resolution does not have space for all 29 slots in a row</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can click outside of the bar to the right to select slots from upper rows</li>
<li>In dialogues, you can still see the hotbar cycling buttons</li>
<li>Combat log button positioning is not adjusted</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixes in this patch:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added SP refund to Reactive Shot tooltip</li>
<li>Updated the infusion deltamod removal to use the new removal PROC (should be compatible with Derpy's deltamod additions now)</li>
<li>Fixed Opportunist charge script after Amer's patch, and removed the patching procedure from the new versioning system (hopefully there are no more issues with this)</li>
<li>Updated the GoTS script to work with the new basic attack script</li>
<li>Fixed Leper rune having old Incons (this might not be retroactive)</li>
<li>Added the AP penalty to Slowed III tooltip<ul>
<li>No clue how to do so for the journal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Updated Horrid Wilting SI reaction script</li>
<li>The modded centurion activator now mentions the 1 ranged charge</li>
<li>Thirst accumulated AP is now lost on death or combat exit</li>
</ul>
<p>For modders:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added Utilities.lua, a table which contains helper methods for adding features in way that is compatible with multiple mods, and some UI helpers<ul>
<li>Can be accessed with Mods[“EpipEncounters”].Utilities</li>
<li>Calls to its methods are not persistent, and you must always make them when the lua engine loads, before the StatsLoaded / SessionLoaded events. In other words, call its methods from the main lua body, not from any listener.</li>
<li>AddArtifactToTreasure() has been moved here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added AddSkillbook(), which functions similarly to the previous method and adds a skillbook to a trader table. Params are the item id (without the I_ prefix that you'd normally use for tables) and the school name, as it appears ingame (capitalized)</li>
<li>You can modify the characterCreationPresetDescriptions subtable to add descriptions to the presets in character creation. The table is commented with the preset that corresponds to the index in the preset selector.</li>
<li>No documentation currently exists for the new stats tab, but do let me know if you want to add your own mod's stats to this panel.</li>
<li>Added GetConfig(), which retrieves a json config file for your mod. Takes two params: the suffix of the config file, and a table containing its default values, for patching old configs with new settings</li>
</ul>
<p>Known issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Picking a talent will not update the new stats</li>
<li>Preset descriptions do not appear until you switch presets at least once</li>
<li>Changing name in character creation causes the skills to disappear (fixed by changing tabs)</li>
<li>Dismantling from right click can get ‘stuck' on some items - this can be fixed by dismantling another one.</li>
<li>Character creation spits a few errors on startup, these are completely harmless (some element is not yet initialized at that point, unsure which one)</li>
<li>New stats fail to update when starting a new playthrough (harmless)</li>
<li>With multiple controlled summons, the gap between their portraits changes when you switch between them</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="v1020-250421">v1020 (25/04/21)<a class="headerlink" href="#v1020-250421" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Boneshaped Crusher now has All-In</li>
<li>Removed Incons from talent menus and characters that had it; you will be refunded Talent Points for characters that had it. Special thanks to Focus for the UI editing help.</li>
<li>Leper now grants Trickster's Repertoire instead of old Inconspicuous</li>
<li>Ending combat with the new incons now automatically unsneaks</li>
<li>Added (hopefully) all the text changes that were missing (infused reactions, artifacts, some talents)</li>
<li>Reactive Shot SI3 refunds 1SP</li>
<li>Added descriptions of the Epic Enemies effects to the condensed tooltip (thanks Derpy)</li>
<li>Presence mutator from Epic Enemies now grants all Presence effects</li>
<li>The custom loading screen is now toggleable, and off by default. To re-enable it, edit EpipEncountersConfig.json in Documents\Larian Studios\Divinity Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition\Osiris Data</li>
<li>For modders: added a function to safely add artifacts to the ST_AMER_UNI treasuretable. Simply call Mods[“EpipEncounters”].AddArtifactToTreasure(statsID) (ex. AddArtifactToTreasure("UNI_AMER_Abyss") ) before the StatsLoaded engine event. You can copy TreasureTables.lua into your mod to use it, if you don't want to have Epip Encounters as a dependency. If I implement more helpers like this, I'll split them off into their own mod.</li>
<li>Fixed opportunist script not running</li>
<li>Fixed Chthonian not appearing as a status on Epic Enemies</li>
<li>Fixed Greatforge item validation breaking<ul>
<li>Warning for other modders: if you're overloading an existing query with Lua, do not do so directly from Ext.NewQuery(), as there is no way to define queries that expect specific params. This causes issues with negating queries. Instead, create a wrapper query in osiris that uses NRD_ModQuery.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: you will need the latest EE update (the one for modders) for the text changes to work properly. Also, you will not see the usual “Epip Encounters has been updated” message as the normal EE one will show up instead.</p>
<ul>
<li>Break the Shackles cleanses dazzled</li>
<li>Inconspicuous rework, as a rework of Master Fletcher (now named Trickster's Repertoire):</li>
<li>You sneak and become invisible for free at the start of combat, until the end of your first turn. At the end of your turn, sneak for free. At the start of your turns, if you were sneaking from this effect, you stop sneaking. Additionally, your special arrows count as basic attacks and you have a 33% chance to recover a special arrow after shooting it.</li>
<li>
<p>Old inconspicuous remains available. At least for now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apotheosis SI3 is now exclusive from the previous SIs, but lasts until your source gen depletes</p>
</li>
<li>Escapist skill costs 0AP, has 5m range, up from 4m</li>
<li>Opportunist grants 2 free generic reaction charges, up from 1</li>
<li>Added a tutorial for when you get an infused reaction node for the first time (kekw)</li>
<li>Executioner grants 2 AP, up from 1</li>
<li>Charity is now once per round per character, rather than once per round</li>
<li>Added meta skills to print SP and resistances</li>
<li>Added correct text for most changes (ascension, artifacts and executioner are still missing)</li>
<li>Fixed using Clouded Memories from bags not consuming them</li>
<li>Fixed finesse recovery for weapon-based skills activating per-target rather than per skill cast</li>
<li>I'm surprised no one tried whirlwind while this lasted</li>
<li>Fixed Prototrophize not granting SP when under infinite SG</li>
<li>It will still extend SG when you're at max sp. I'm not sure what the behaviour should be in that case.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="v1001-30421">v1001 (3/04/21)<a class="headerlink" href="#v1001-30421" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Drill Sockets merging damage types for weapons</li>
<li>Fixed permanent Prosperity keyword from Hothead talent - loading a save will recalculate your legitimate sources</li>
