<li>Possibly fixed unidentified items showing the weapon range deltamods in the tooltip</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="v1040-191021">v1040 (19/10/21)</h2>
<ul>

<li>Fixed EE stats tab not working for new companions until a reload</li>
<li>Fixed sliders in the options menu being saved with +1 step than what you've set them to</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="v1039-171021">v1039 (17/10/21)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed SI tooltip highlighting not working for a few schools</li>
<li>Fixed wrong earth damage color in shift-tooltips</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="v1038-161021">v1038 (16/10/21)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added a hotbar hotkey to use the skill/item on the very last slot of your hotbar (right-most in 5th row)<ul>
<li>Can use this to make a Source Vamp hotkey, for example</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Weapon range deltamods now show up like regular deltamods on the tooltip, and the weapon range display is split up to show both base and extra range</li>
<li>Holding the show cones button (shift by default) will display skill damage as their multipliers</li>
<li>When infusing or when the shift key is held, unmet SI requirements will be displayed in red text</li>

<li>Artifact items now show quality</li>
<li>Added an option to log all UI ExternalInterface calls and invokes to the console, visible in the settings menu if the extender developer mode is enabled</li>

<li>Let me know if something that used to work before broke all of a sudden</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed an error in the console when hovering over armor whose subtype could not be determined (ex. the starting tattered equipment)</li>
<li>Character Creation UI now implements machine learning and blockchain technology to notify you of possible typos in your character names</li>
<li>Added a WIP custom talents feature. See <code>EpipTalents.lua</code> for usage example. You can also hide any non-racial talent.<ul>
<li>Shortcomings:</li>
<li>They will only display on kb+m. No controller UI support yet.</li>
<li>They do not show up in the examine UI yet.</li>
<li>Requirements are not rechecked while moving ability/attribute points around in the mirror; upon exiting, you will still lose any talents you cannot sustain</li>
<li>Can't bind them to deltamods</li>
<li>Rarely, the mirror UI might show you having fewer talent points than you do - this should fix itself if you exit the mirror and go back in (if someone has a save where this happens consistently, let me know)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As a result of the talent UI changes, the bug with unequipping walk-it-off should be fixed</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="v1037-21021">v1037 (2/10/21)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed right-most zeros getting culled in stat adjustment tooltips</li>
<li>Added a new setting to disable fog of war (server-wide, host-only, non-destructive; can be reverted)<ul>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="v1036-11021">v1036 (1/10/21)</h2>

<li>Removed the obsolete "From LW: -0%" tooltip text from character sheet</li>

<li>Added an option to auto-unlock inventories in multiplayer upon loading a save. This setting is per player.</li>
<li>Fixed negative stat adjustments not being grouped together in tooltips</li>
<li>Equipment now shows a "Quality" rating in tooltips, which denotes how good its damage/armor roll was. An item with 100% Quality has the best roll (only possible for Divines)</li>
<li>Trickster's Repertoire now grants invisibility+sneaking until the start of your first turn, and only causes you to sneak starting from your second round. Additionally, at the start of your turns, you always unsneak.</li>
<li>Changed wording for the Hothead tooltip</li>
<li>Fixed error spam in console upon reload, and reorganized some code</li>
<li>Added a lifesteal stat to the stats tab (will update upon changing Necromancy points, or in combat)</li>

<h2 id="v1035-120921">v1035 (12/09/21)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Replaced the config json file with an ingame settings menu, available from the game's normal "Gameplay settings" tab</li>
<li>Unidentified artifacts now show their rarity as artifact, and use the custom color</li>

<li>Fixed Trickster's Repertoire breaking sneaking from other effects that cause you to sneak</li>
<li>Fixed hotbar initialization message (again)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="v1032-050921">v1032 (05/09/21)</h2>
<p>Small patch with some QoL for dyes and a fix for a Finesse issue.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dyeing equipped items will now re-quip them automatically</li>
<li>Changed the finesse recovery for weapon-based skills to fix an issue with delayed procs if multiple things used its logic</li>
<li>Removed the option to show enemy lvl in healthbar (still buggy!)</li>

<h2 id="v1030-300821">v1030 (30/08/21)</h2>
<p>Monthly patch to appease our ever-so-hungry Derpy overlord.</p>

<li>Hotbar slot keys now work as expected - ex. pressing "4" will use the fourth skill on the bottom bar, regardless of the row it's set to</li>

<li>Vanilla actions (ex. open journal) will always show the vanilla keybind instead of the custom one (it will still work, though)</li>
</ul>

<li>Changed the default hotbar bindings to swap ping with combat log</li>
<li>Added a hotbar action for Portable Respec Mirror, if its mod is loaded</li>

<li>Fixed dragging items onto the world not working if the hotbar was enabled</li>
<li>Fixed the add/remove rows button being available on summons after opening the pause menu</li>
<li>You can no longer use hotbar action hotkeys in dialogues (or other occasions where the UI is entirely hidden), when there is a UI element focused, or when the game is paused</li>
<li>Fixed name of hotbar slot 6 binding in the input menu</li>
<li>Fixed Slowed 3 AP penalty stacking</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="v1029-060821">v1029 (06/08/21)</h2>
<ul>

<li>Toggle party link hotbar hotkey is now instant (no casting animation)</li>
<li>Added a one-row layout to the hotbar actions bar, which is automatically used when you only have one row of skill slots active<ul>
<li>You can control the behaviour with the new hotbarHotkeysLayout setting: "auto" is the behaviour described above, "single" makes it always use the 1-row layout, "dual" forces it to always be two rows (like how it was before)</li>
<li>Keyboard hotkeys remain functional at all times, even if the buttons are hidden</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed "c" displaying on the hotbar button you're dragging</li>
<li>DoT statuses now show their calculated damage<ul>
<li>The display fluctuates for a bit after a skill cast, might redo this entirely later to not rely on the engine damage formula</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Centurion Battlestomp can now only be cast if the target is at &lt;10m, and does not consume the ranged charge</li>
<li>Tried banishing the "Enemy Turn" message again</li>
</ul>

<p>This patch contains numerous fixes and the first part of the rework of hotbar hotkeys. Happy birthday Derpy!</p>
<ul>
<li>Replaced the tutorials tab in the journal with a patch notes tab<ul>
<li>See EpipPatchNotes.lua for an example on how to use this in your own mod.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Artifact tooltips now show "Artifact" as rarity rather than Unique</li>
</ul>
<p>Hotbar Updates</p>
<ul>
<li>Added customizable hotbar action hotkeys/buttons. Drag and drop to rearrange/assign them, right click to bring up a list of all actions. Mods can add their own actions very easily; see HotbarActions.lua for an example.</li>
<li>To use them with keyboard keys, assign the "Hotbar Hotkey #" keys from the game's controls menu. Rebinding them will be easier in the future. You must also enable them within the config file.</li>
<li>This rework is a work-in-progress, both in terms of functionality and art; in the future there will also be a 1-row layout.</li>
<li>The multihotbar is now enabled by default. Set "disableHotbar" to true in the config file to disable it. (the old setting now does nothing)</li>
<li>Deprecated the Infusion and Meditate hotkeys; please use the hotbar version of them from now on.</li>
<li>Summons can no longer add hotbar rows</li>
<li>All the custom elements should now hide during dialogues</li>
<li>Fixed jankiness when using low resolutions</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixes</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed player status bar sometimes clipping through portraits and appearing to the left of them</li>
<li>Fixed stat adjustments tooltip not working properly on resists</li>
<li>Fixed stat adjustments tooltip eating up all other boosts</li>
<li>Fixed boss frame in the enemy health bar UI. It should work consistently now</li>
<li>Leper rune now should properly grant the talent when it's socketed into an equipped item</li>
<li>Fixed being able to infuse out-of-turn with the hotkey (rest in peace gigabrain infused reaction builds)</li>
<li>Possibly disabled turn notifications on the hotbar health bar</li>
</ul>
<p>Known issues</p>
<ul>
<li>"Actions" drawer (attack/sneak/sheathe) does not work well along with the default keyboard hotkey, and the menu is not repositioned</li>
<li>Buttons on the hotbar don't yet light up like they do in vanilla</li>
<li>Order of actions in drawer is random</li>
<li>Some hotbar buttons do not have state animations yet</li>
<li>The title in the patch notes menu will not be the right color the first time after a reload</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Earlier changelogs are available on the old google doc. Man, v1026 was quite the breakthrough!</p>
