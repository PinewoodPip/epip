<ul>
<li>If "Unfocus after sending messages" is enabled, holding shift while sending a chat message will keep the chat focused</li>
<li>Fixed settings not saving if you didn't visit the camera settings tab</li>
</ul>
<p>On the technical side of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added operator overload annotations for <code>RGBColor</code>, <code>Vector</code></li>
<li><code>Vector.Create()</code> accepts an existing array as a parameter (only one)</li>
<li>Added TSK-related methods to <code>Text</code><ul>
<li>This includes a localization system for strings in scripts; you can generate templates for localizing with <code>Text.GenerateLocalizationTemplate()</code> and they will be loaded from <code>Mods/MyMod_MyGuid/Localization/Epip/MyTargetLanguage/ModTable.json</code>, where <code>ModTable</code> is the mod table whose strings you've localized using the template<ul>
<li>Support for this within Epip will be added throughout future updates; currently only some camera settings support this</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can generate fresh GUIDs or TSK handles with <code>!guid</code> and <code>!tskhandle</code> commands (on client context); they'll be copied to the clipboard</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="v1062-160922">v1062 - 16/09/22<a class="headerlink" href="#v1062-160922" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Surface tooltips with an owner now show a hint regarding how the damage scales</li>
<li>"Active Defense" statuses (ex. Empyrean Tears) now show remaining charges</li>
<li>EE rune materials now show how to use them to craft runes</li>
<li>Added a setting to configure the delay of simple tooltips appearing<ul>
<li>This affects tooltips of items in the world, as well as label tooltips in UIs (these 2 types are individually configurable)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added a settings tab for camera settings<ul>
<li>You can change the maximum zoom out distance, as well as the view angles</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Items in the quest reward screen now show a hint regarding modifier generation</li>
<li>Added new Greatforge graphics for Engrave - special thanks to Cathe and Elric!</li>
<li>Fixed a vanilla bug with the character sheet that caused the second ring slot to not play equip animations<ul>
<li>Additionally, the graphics involved should now be better centered</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Re-added the option to auto-unlock inventories<ul>
<li>Changing the lock status should also be synched better now - the vanilla game seems to struggle with this leading to the changes often not being properly reflected in other player's UIs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed weapon range deltamods only considering the first deltamod of that kind found<ul>
<li>This same fix is applied for weapon elemental damage mods as well</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On the technical side of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replaced <code>Client.GetCharacter()</code> implementation with a new one from v57 that doesn't rely on any UIs. <strong>Let me know if something character-involved breaks as a result</strong> (though I haven't experienced any difference).</li>
<li>Added a Camera library</li>
<li>Added an Entity library, with shorthands for GetGameObject() and functions to get all characters/items on a level</li>
<li>Added limited alpha support to RGBColor (I don't think alpha is used anywhere in scripting though)</li>
<li><code>Item.GetIcon()</code> is now fully reimplemented following engine code</li>
<li>Stats library now also holds dynamically generated data of runes, except framed ones</li>
<li>Tooltip library now supports item tooltips and simple tooltips (the usual <code>showTooltip</code> call), and offers additional contextual data (ex. skill ID for skill tooltips)</li>
<li>Started work on a new UI-independent settings library with per-profile settings support; not yet used</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="v1061-40922">v1061 - 4/09/22<a class="headerlink" href="#v1061-40922" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added new settings for world item tooltips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emphasizing containers, consumables and/or equipment by changing their color<ul>
<li>This setting will not work for items that would result in a crime upon interaction; they will remain red.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enabling world tooltips for all items (similar to the "Let there be tooltips" mod)</li>
<li>Filtering out clutter (particularly the one added by the setting above): chairs, doors, non-interactable items</li>
<li>Option to open containers upon clicking their tooltip, rather than picking them up</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added an option to exit the chat UI after sending a message (so you don't need to press escape manually)</p>
</li>
<li>Added an option to disable notifications for sharing civils ("X shares Loremaster/LC with Z")</li>
<li>Searching saves is now case-insensitive</li>
<li>
<p>Added a ping counter to the debug display</p>
<ul>
<li>Since the server only responds to net messages once per game tick, the counter will basically always show around 33ms in singleplayer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed "Show empty containers/bodies" not actually working on items</p>
</li>
<li>Fixed another case of an infinite loop of switching characters</li>
<li>Fixed the "toggle world tooltips" keybind not working (+ crashing the game)</li>
<li>Fixed some character sheet tooltips appearing in the vanity UI</li>
</ul>
<p>On the technical side of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Osiris library now converts boolean values to integer in calls</li>
<li>Added <code>HasFlag()</code>, <code>IsContainer()</code> to Item library</li>
<li>Added initial groundwork for an inventory expansion</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="v1060-30922">v1060 - 3/09/22<a class="headerlink" href="#v1060-30922" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Added a better frame for the hotbar health bar, and shadows for the AP bar (thanks Elric)</li>
<li>Added a keybind to bring up the examine UI (the real one)</li>
<li>Added all engine actions (the ones you see in the controller UI) to the hotbar actions drawer (the vanilla one, bound to <code>X</code>), except for flee</li>
<li>Reordered some keybindings</li>
<li>Added "Let there be tooltips" to the list of EE-incompatible mods</li>
<li>Fixed character-specific context menus appearing on items</li>
<li>Fixed the save/load overlay not disappearing in multiplayer when the UI is closed</li>
<li>Fixed a possible edge case with walking over corpses in combat that would result in the corpse not being lootable after combat</li>
<li>Fixed the dragging area for the debug display being too large</li>

<ul>
<li>Added an option to enable improvements to the combat log.

<li>Osiris table's DB queries now return the list of tuples as the last return value, always</li>
<li>Added a separate UI for querying time from flash</li>
<li>Fixed time functions not accounting for daylight savings (iggy oversight)</li>
<li>Added annotations for the _Feature table/class</li>
<li>Added a <code>Text</code> library with a handy format function</li>
<li>Improvements to events and hooks: libraries can now hold their events and hooks as tables in <code>Event</code> and <code>Hooks</code> fields respectively, from which you can easily see all listener types available and register listeners. Doing it this way enables auto-completion and intellisense/EmmyLua annotations for listener parameters, which was not possible before. Old libraries will slowly be updated to use this, and the old method of registering listeners will stay.</li>
</ul>
<p>The standalone hotbar mod will be updated tomorrow (15th May).</p>

<p>As of today, Epip is now one year old! My attention span for projects tends to be very low (as evidenced by my other EE stuff), but Epip looks to be an exception to that and it's incredible what it has become - all its UI changes were nearly unimaginable just a year ago. Thank you all for the support throughout the months, even at times when the patches were a buggy mess.</p>
<p>Just like the initial release of the mod on April 1st, this anniversary patch is very real, and best experienced on this day of the month.</p>
<p>Changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pressing escape while in the EE UIs now backs out of them rather than bring up the pause menu</li>
<li>The stats tab now shows damage dealt and received in the current fight (or previous fight, when out of combat)</li>
<li>Added a new bug to the character sheet</li>
<li>Performance improvements to the hotbar</li>
<li>Gold/Splinter counter in the stats tab should now be more reliable</li>
<li>Minor technical changes to make the mod compatible with Descent</li>
<li>Added a scrollbar to the hotbar buttons drawer</li>
<li>The hotbar now goes below the inventory and character sheet</li>
<li>Hotbar cooldown animations should now be smoother</li>
<li>Fixed bugs with unbinding actions in the hotbar, as well as clearing unmemorized slots</li>
<li>Fixed muted characters not having their slots greyed out in hotbar</li>
<li>You can now activate your Epip Encounters license ingame from the options menu</li>
<li>Tooltips can now be scrolled on one axis with the mouse wheel</li>
<li>The punisher now drops MicroBoss™ loot to make him feel more optional</li>
<li>Added a cinematic camera option, on by default</li>
<li>Reworked the vanity feature: it now opens a custom tab in your character sheet. Browsing templates is a lot more convenient this way. Saved outfits are now categorized by race &amp; gender (doesn't stop you from applying them to anyone though)<ul>
<li>It wouldn't be an Epip patch if something didn't ship unfinished, which is why I must announce that the promised feature to mark templates as favorite did not make it in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="New transmog menu." src="../img/transmog.png" /></p>
<p><strong>On the technical side of things:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added an alias for the <code>Ext</code> table to make it easier to type:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-lua">SEX = Ext -- Short for &quot;Script EXtender&quot;
SEX.Print(&quot;Welcome to Norbyte's SEX v56 !&quot;)
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Fixed more inconsistencies with copy/paste in the message boxes</li>
<li>Added an option to log AI scoring to the console: the top 3 actions will be shown anytime decisions are made. Work-in-progress as some of the AI features in the extender are currently bugged.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="AI Logging." src="../img/ai.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Tooltips for Ascension stats in the stats tab are now created dynamically, so there's no need to edit them if you've edited the description/name</li>
<li>Added a <code>Server</code> table on the client, from which listeners for any Osiris symbol can be created, eliminating the need for boilerplate code on the server side if you need to listen for Osiris stuff.</li>
<li>Added an <code>Osiris</code> table on server to make user queries and DB queries a bit less aids to use in lua:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- DBs with only one tuple return their contents directly, rather than as a list
local _, value = Osiris.DB_PIP_EpicStats_DamageDealt(char.MyGuid, nil)

-- User queries can also return variables directly from their output DBs, even for queries with multiple outputs
local value = Osiris.QRY_AMER_KeywordStat_VitalityVoid_GetRadius(char.MyGuid, 1)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>On the future side of things:</strong></p>
<p>Development has slowed down throughout March due to work and studies, but I'm not planning on stopping work on Epip anytime soon, and there are lots of exciting features in the planning stages. There is no time estimate for any of them, they're just things I know I will try out <em>eventually</em>. I know creating expectations never ends up well, but for the anniversary I felt it would be nice to write down the ideas I'm planning for the near future:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Character sheet overhaul:</strong> the attribute/ability/talent tabs will become easily moddable, for modifying or adding new entries to them. This will pave the way for custom attributes and abilities. The UI currently used for the custom vanity tab will be made generic, so anyone can add their own tabs.</li>
<li><strong>Proper controller support for EE UIs:</strong> a large undertaking, but something that looks to be very possible and would be a massive quality of life improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Custom journal UI:</strong> will replace the current changelog functionality. The plan is to use the GM mode's journal UI as a base, since it's a slick, full-screen UI with support for nested categories. The functionality will be made generic, you'd be able to use it for more than just changelogs.</li>
<li><strong>A way to create UIs just from lua:</strong> work on this already started back in early January; it's used for the [REDACTED] in Fort Joy, but it's quite incomplete. The plan is to allow for creation of UIs with backgrounds, text, and all the Larian form elements (buttons, dropdowns, sliders etc.), all without touching any swf.</li>
<li>More documentation for the source code, namely the remaining UI scripts and the base metatables</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for reading and I hope you have an epic 1st of April.</p>
<h3 id="19222-huge-hotbar-rewrite">19/2/22 Huge Hotbar rewrite<a class="headerlink" href="#19222-huge-hotbar-rewrite" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Rewrote the hotbar UI. This involves mostly technical changes, in preparations for a standalone release.</p>
<p><strong>Your hotkey keybindings will be reset with this update! Please bind them again.</strong></p>
<p>Visible changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the top of the buttons area blocking clicks onto the world and other UIs</li>
<li>Any skill or item can now be dragged from the hotbar to the customizable buttons to bind it there (useful for old mods that use skills/items to bring up menus)<ul>
<li>The "use last slot" action has been removed due to this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Removed the "view changelog" action</li>
<li>The slot rendering is now entirely scripted (no help from the engine) which works around a crash and removes the need for an initialization procedure (that annoying "switch to the first row" message)</li>
<li>Saving your current amount of bars and order should be a lot more reliable (now happens upon pausing the game, instead of a timer)</li>
<li>Action buttons can now be highlighted or disabled; ex. the pyramids one is disabled if the party has no pyramids</li>
<li>Added an action to open the pyramids UI</li>
<li>Fixed the source skill border clipping into other rows</li>
<li>Added compatibility for Weapon Expansion: adds an action for toggling the menu, and repositions the original button when you have 2 rows of action buttons</li>
<li>Actions in the drawer are now ordered in a consistent manner</li>
<li>Added a context menu when you right click a row; from there, you can:<ul>
<li>"Push" groups of slots to the left/right (useful for inserting skills inbetween slots)</li>
<li>Clear rows, or unmemorized skills</li>
<li>Save and load "loadouts" of rows. Loadouts can be applied even if your character doesn't currently know all the skills from it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple tooltips (the ones that go in that very small black box) now appear much faster, rather than being delayed</li>
<li>Added numerous calls to <code>Game.Character</code> and <code>Game.Item</code>, mostly related to functionality needed for the hotbar.</li>
</ul>

<p>This patch contains numerous fixes and the first part of the rework of hotbar hotkeys. Happy birthday Derpy!</p>
<ul>
<li>Replaced the tutorials tab in the journal with a patch notes tab<ul>
<li>See EpipPatchNotes.lua for an example on how to use this in your own mod.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Artifact tooltips now show "Artifact" as rarity rather than Unique</li>
</ul>
<p>Hotbar Updates</p>
<ul>
<li>Added customizable hotbar action hotkeys/buttons. Drag and drop to rearrange/assign them, right click to bring up a list of all actions. Mods can add their own actions very easily; see HotbarActions.lua for an example.</li>
<li>To use them with keyboard keys, assign the "Hotbar Hotkey #" keys from the game's controls menu. Rebinding them will be easier in the future. You must also enable them within the config file.</li>
<li>This rework is a work-in-progress, both in terms of functionality and art; in the future there will also be a 1-row layout.</li>
<li>The multihotbar is now enabled by default. Set "disableHotbar" to true in the config file to disable it. (the old setting now does nothing)</li>
<li>Deprecated the Infusion and Meditate hotkeys; please use the hotbar version of them from now on.</li>
<li>Summons can no longer add hotbar rows</li>
<li>All the custom elements should now hide during dialogues</li>
<li>Fixed jankiness when using low resolutions</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixes</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed player status bar sometimes clipping through portraits and appearing to the left of them</li>
<li>Fixed stat adjustments tooltip not working properly on resists</li>
<li>Fixed stat adjustments tooltip eating up all other boosts</li>
<li>Fixed boss frame in the enemy health bar UI. It should work consistently now</li>
<li>Leper rune now should properly grant the talent when it's socketed into an equipped item</li>
<li>Fixed being able to infuse out-of-turn with the hotkey (rest in peace gigabrain infused reaction builds)</li>
<li>Possibly disabled turn notifications on the hotbar health bar</li>
</ul>
<p>Known issues</p>
<ul>
<li>"Actions" drawer (attack/sneak/sheathe) does not work well along with the default keyboard hotkey, and the menu is not repositioned</li>
<li>Buttons on the hotbar don't yet light up like they do in vanilla</li>
<li>Order of actions in drawer is random</li>
<li>Some hotbar buttons do not have state animations yet</li>
<li>The title in the patch notes menu will not be the right color the first time after a reload</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Earlier changelogs are available on the old google doc. Man, v1026 was quite the breakthrough!</p>
