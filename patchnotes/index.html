<p>The latest versions of the mod require v56 of the extender.</p>
<p>To get it, create a file named <code>OsiUpdateChannel.txt</code> in the same directory where you installed the extender (where <code>DXGI.dll</code> is) with the contents:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">Devel
</code></pre>
<h2 id="v1048-140522">v1048 - 14/05/22<a class="headerlink" href="#v1048-140522" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11Zz6D80HVBFh6rUsyQFVQDi_eKjAjyZw/view?usp=sharing">Download here</a>. (14/05/22)</p>
<ul>
<li>Added a warning upon loading a save with mods known to be problematic</li>
<li>Graying out hotbar slots while casting skills should now work similarly to before</li>
<li>Added Derpy's scripted encounters to the Treasure Table Display</li>
<li>Added an option to disable area transition labels or change their duration. It now also hides immediately if you hover over a character/item to bring up its healthbar</li>
<li>Possibly fixed a significant stuttering issue with the hotbar</li>
<li>Added a button to revert a transmog'd item's appearance (not retroactive; will only work on newly transmogged items)</li>
<li>Changing tabs in the Vanity UI now plays a sound</li>
<li>Rounded the numbers in the Treasure Table Display</li>
<li>Added a dyes tab to the vanity menu<ul>
<li>RGB sliders are not finished yet (you can use them in developer mode, but they will not be saved)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On the technical side:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a net error message upon loading into the main menu</li>
<li>Fixed a startup error related to the Osiris table</li>
<li>Added UIObject flag helper methods to the UI table (though Norbyte confirmed these will be usable like other enums in the future)</li>
<li>Added ways to set and delete tuples to the Osiris table with :Set() and :Delete(); :Get() queries the DB (previous usage still works).</li>
<li>Osiris table's DB queries now return the list of tuples as the last return value, always</li>
<li>Added a separate UI for querying time from flash</li>
<li>Fixed time functions not accounting for daylight savings (iggy oversight)</li>
<li>Added annotations for the _Feature table/class</li>
<li>Added a <code>Text</code> library with a handy format function</li>
<li>Improvements to events and hooks: libraries can now hold their events and hooks as tables in <code>Event</code> and <code>Hooks</code> fields respectively, from which you can easily see all listener types available and register listeners. Doing it this way enables auto-completion and intellisense/EmmyLua annotations for listener parameters, which was not possible before. Old libraries will slowly be updated to use this, and the old method of registering listeners will stay.</li>
</ul>
<p>The standalone hotbar mod will be updated tomorrow (15th May).</p>

<ul>
<li>Added an option to show artifact/protean chances on enemy health bars when the "Show Sneak Cones" (shift by default) key is held. Also works on containers, without needing the key to be held. </li>
<li>Fixed an issue with some setup event being unreliable (likely the source of many hotbar problems)</li>
<li>Fixed some events being fired once per user</li>
<li>Fixed equip animations in the character sheet</li>
<li>Client timers are now truly client-side<ul>
<li>As a result hotkey'd skills on the hotbar should now have a lot less delay</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed hotbar not being greyed out for dead characters</li>
<li>Fixed "None"-type weapons not being considered melee, causing incarnate bull rush to appear grayed out in the hotbar</li>
<li>Fixed another large performance issue with the stats tab</li>

<li>Added a new journal UI, replaces the quest log for changelogs. Access it from the hotbar</li>
<li>Fixed Inconspicuous not being hidden in character creation</li>
<li>Hotbar config (hotkeys) now also saves when you save the game, not just when the game is paused</li>

<li>Reduced logging when developer mode is off</li>

<h2 id="v1045-1422-anniversary-patch-flashed">v1045 - 1/4/22 Anniversary patch :flashed:<a class="headerlink" href="#v1045-1422-anniversary-patch-flashed" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>As of today, Epip is now one year old! My attention span for projects tends to be very low (as evidenced by my other EE stuff), but Epip looks to be an exception to that and it's incredible what it has become - all its UI changes were nearly unimaginable just a year ago. Thank you all for the support throughout the months, even at times when the patches were a buggy mess.</p>
<p>Just like the initial release of the mod on April 1st, this anniversary patch is very real, and best experienced on this day of the month.</p>
<p>Changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pressing escape while in the EE UIs now backs out of them rather than bring up the pause menu</li>
<li>The stats tab now shows damage dealt and received in the current fight (or previous fight, when out of combat)</li>
<li>Added a new bug to the character sheet</li>
<li>Performance improvements to the hotbar</li>
<li>Gold/Splinter counter in the stats tab should now be more reliable</li>
<li>Minor technical changes to make the mod compatible with Descent</li>
<li>Added a scrollbar to the hotbar buttons drawer</li>
<li>The hotbar now goes below the inventory and character sheet</li>
<li>Hotbar cooldown animations should now be smoother</li>
<li>Fixed bugs with unbinding actions in the hotbar, as well as clearing unmemorized slots</li>
<li>Fixed muted characters not having their slots greyed out in hotbar</li>
<li>You can now activate your Epip Encounters license ingame from the options menu</li>
<li>Tooltips can now be scrolled on one axis with the mouse wheel</li>
<li>The punisher now drops MicroBoss™ loot to make him feel more optional</li>
<li>Added a cinematic camera option, on by default</li>
<li>Reworked the vanity feature: it now opens a custom tab in your character sheet. Browsing templates is a lot more convenient this way. Saved outfits are now categorized by race &amp; gender (doesn't stop you from applying them to anyone though)<ul>
<li>It wouldn't be an Epip patch if something didn't ship unfinished, which is why I must announce that the promised feature to mark templates as favorite did not make it in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="New transmog menu." src="../img/transmog.png" /></p>
<p><strong>On the technical side of things:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added an alias for the <code>Ext</code> table to make it easier to type:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-lua">SEX = Ext -- Short for &quot;Script EXtender&quot;
SEX.Print(&quot;Welcome to Norbyte's SEX v56 !&quot;)
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Fixed more inconsistencies with copy/paste in the message boxes</li>
<li>Added an option to log AI scoring to the console: the top 3 actions will be shown anytime decisions are made. Work-in-progress as some of the AI features in the extender are currently bugged.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="AI Logging." src="../img/ai.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Tooltips for Ascension stats in the stats tab are now created dynamically, so there's no need to edit them if you've edited the description/name</li>
<li>Added a <code>Server</code> table on the client, from which listeners for any Osiris symbol can be created, eliminating the need for boilerplate code on the server side if you need to listen for Osiris stuff.</li>
<li>Added an <code>Osiris</code> table on server to make user queries and DB queries a bit less aids to use in lua:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- DBs with only one tuple return their contents directly, rather than as a list
local _, value = Osiris.DB_PIP_EpicStats_DamageDealt(char.MyGuid, nil)

-- User queries can also return variables directly from their output DBs, even for queries with multiple outputs
local value = Osiris.QRY_AMER_KeywordStat_VitalityVoid_GetRadius(char.MyGuid, 1)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>On the future side of things:</strong></p>
<p>Development has slowed down throughout March due to work and studies, but I'm not planning on stopping work on Epip anytime soon, and there are lots of exciting features in the planning stages. There is no time estimate for any of them, they're just things I know I will try out <em>eventually</em>. I know creating expectations never ends up well, but for the anniversary I felt it would be nice to write down the ideas I'm planning for the near future:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Character sheet overhaul:</strong> the attribute/ability/talent tabs will become easily moddable, for modifying or adding new entries to them. This will pave the way for custom attributes and abilities. The UI currently used for the custom vanity tab will be made generic, so anyone can add their own tabs.</li>
<li><strong>Proper controller support for EE UIs:</strong> a large undertaking, but something that looks to be very possible and would be a massive quality of life improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Custom journal UI:</strong> will replace the current changelog functionality. The plan is to use the GM mode's journal UI as a base, since it's a slick, full-screen UI with support for nested categories. The functionality will be made generic, you'd be able to use it for more than just changelogs.</li>
<li><strong>A way to create UIs just from lua:</strong> work on this already started back in early January; it's used for the [REDACTED] in Fort Joy, but it's quite incomplete. The plan is to allow for creation of UIs with backgrounds, text, and all the Larian form elements (buttons, dropdowns, sliders etc.), all without touching any swf.</li>
<li>More documentation for the source code, namely the remaining UI scripts and the base metatables</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for reading and I hope you have an epic 1st of April.</p>
<h3 id="19222-huge-hotbar-rewrite">19/2/22 Huge Hotbar rewrite<a class="headerlink" href="#19222-huge-hotbar-rewrite" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Rewrote the hotbar UI. This involves mostly technical changes, in preparations for a standalone release.</p>
<p><strong>Your hotkey keybindings will be reset with this update! Please bind them again.</strong></p>
<p>Visible changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the top of the buttons area blocking clicks onto the world and other UIs</li>
<li>Any skill or item can now be dragged from the hotbar to the customizable buttons to bind it there (useful for old mods that use skills/items to bring up menus)<ul>
<li>The "use last slot" action has been removed due to this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Removed the "view changelog" action</li>
<li>The slot rendering is now entirely scripted (no help from the engine) which works around a crash and removes the need for an initialization procedure (that annoying "switch to the first row" message)</li>
<li>Saving your current amount of bars and order should be a lot more reliable (now happens upon pausing the game, instead of a timer)</li>
<li>Action buttons can now be highlighted or disabled; ex. the pyramids one is disabled if the party has no pyramids</li>
<li>Added an action to open the pyramids UI</li>
<li>Fixed the source skill border clipping into other rows</li>
<li>Added compatibility for Weapon Expansion: adds an action for toggling the menu, and repositions the original button when you have 2 rows of action buttons</li>
<li>Actions in the drawer are now ordered in a consistent manner</li>
<li>Added a context menu when you right click a row; from there, you can:<ul>
<li>"Push" groups of slots to the left/right (useful for inserting skills inbetween slots)</li>
<li>Clear rows, or unmemorized skills</li>
<li>Save and load "loadouts" of rows. Loadouts can be applied even if your character doesn't currently know all the skills from it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other changes:</p>
