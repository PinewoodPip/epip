# Animation Cancelling
Animation Cancelling is a feature that greatly speeds up combat by ending the player's skill-casting animations once their effects apply. You may enable it from the "General" settings tab.

This is particularly helpful for summon skills, which consist mostly of end-lag.

Unlike implementations in older mods, Epip's Animation Cancelling works properly with many skill types that were previously problematic, such as multi-projectile or jump skills. Additionally, most of the settings apply per-player, rather than globally. Attack animations can also be shortened in this way with the *"Cancel attack animations"* setting.

A separate setting exists to enable animation cancelling for NPCs (*"Cancel NPC animations"*), which will cancel both their skill and attack animations.

An additional setting exists to speed up picking items by clicking their world tooltips (*"Speed up world tooltip item pickups"*) - normally this prevents your character from acting until the animation completes, which is inconsistent with regular item pickups.
