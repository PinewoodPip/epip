# Animation Cancelling
Animation Cancelling is a feature that greatly speeds up combat by ending the player's skill-casting animations once their effects apply. You may enable it from the "General" settings tab.

This is particularly helpful for summon skills, which consist mostly of end-lag.

Unlike previous implementations, Epip's Animation Cancelling works properly with many skill types that were previously problematic, such as multi-projectile or jump skills. Additionally, the setting applies per-player, rather than globally.

This feature is currently only available for player characters. For enemies, use EE's Faster AI Spells mod.

An additional setting exists to speed up picking items by clicking their world tooltips (*"Speed up world tooltip item pickups"*) - normally this prevents your character from acting until the animation completes, which is inconsistent with regular item pickups.
