### Basics
Transmog options consist of vanilla armor variants and options added by cosmetic mods. **Support is included for ["Majora's Project Fashion Sins"](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1815898410), ["Rendal's NPC Armors"](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1515827226) and ["Visitors from Cyseal"](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2828485171) mods.**  
Using transmog is as easy as clicking on your desired option, no extra items or materials required.  
**This change is purely cosmetic and has no effect on gameplay! Your equipment will not lose its stats, modifiers nor set effects. Yes, it works with Gift Bag 5 armor sets.**

### Autotransmog
Found your perfect look? Want to keep it for the rest of the game? "Lock Appearance" option is here for you. When it's ticked newly equipped gear will be automatically transmogrified to match your previous look.  
**This option is saved per-slot.**  
**Automatic transmogrification will only happen if you don't have Vanity menu open.**

### Visibility
Want to go for more outlandish look? Make your equipment invisible with a press of a button! *We trust you to use this option responsibly and only hide your shields and/or weapons for the coolness factor instead of making your characters walk around butt-naked.*
