# Miscellaneous Quality-of-life

This page lists various brief quality-of-life features that do not fit other feature showcase pages.

- A keybind exists to automatically & rapidly pick dialogue options (*"Fast-forward dialogues"* in the "Miscellaneous UI" tab, unbound by default)
    - This is essentially a button-mashing macro, as fast as possible
    - You can configure which options to pick (first, last or random) with the *"Fast-forward strategy"* setting
- A setting & keybind exists to toggle the Minimap UI ("*Show Minimap*" & *"Toggle Minimap"* respectively)
- A *"Allow walking to corpses in combat"* setting exists to allow clicking through corpses in combat to make your character move to the clicked spot rather than loot the corpse; holding shift temporarily disables this.
