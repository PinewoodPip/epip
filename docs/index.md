# Epip

Epip is an extensive UI and quality-of-life mod for *Divinity: Original Sin 2* that introduces dozens of usability improvements to vanilla UIs, as well as numerous new custom UIs to fulfill needs the original ones cannot. See [the features section](#features) for details.

Epip implements improvements such as a **larger hotbar**, **multi-select in inventories**, **equipment transmog and RGB dyes**, unlocked camera and much, much more, while staying unintrusive out-of-the-box and deeply customizable.

Vast customization for Epip's features is available through an in-game [settings menu](Features/SettingsMenu.md) - you may use as many or as few features as you like, with most of them being disabled by default.

## Other features
Major features have dedicated pages for them accessible from the sidebar. The rest of this front page is a listing of other minor features not yet categorized into other pages.

!!! info "Settings Info"
    Many features are disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled from the [Settings Menu](Features/SettingsMenu.md).

    This is to make the mod less overwhelming, as well as to respect that not all of its features will appeal to every player.

- **[🧼 General UI Improvements](Features/UI.md)**: improvements to the vanilla UIs as well as some minor custom UIs.
- **[🔧 Vanilla Fixes](Features/VanillaFixes.md)**: fixes to various vanilla client issues.
- **[🎮 Controller Support](Features/ControllerSupport.md)**: information on which Epip features currently support controllers.
- **[❇️ Miscellaneous QoL](Features/MiscellaneousQoL.md)**: list of various quality-of-life improvements that do not fit other feature pages.

## UI

### Target Health Bar
The health bar shown at the top of the screen has been reworked to look better and include more information, showing resistances, Battered/Harried in Epic Encounters, as well as AP, SP, initiative and more while holding ++lshift++ - saving you many trips to the examine UI. More details [here](Features/UI.md#target-status-bar).

<center>![Health bar showcase](Features/img/ui/health_bar.png)</center>
<center>![Health bar alt](Features/img/ui/health_bar_shift.png)</center>

### Player Portraits
The player portraits UI has received various improvements:

- The list of statuses will now wrap onto a second row, preventing them from obscuring most of your screen.
- An improved status bar can be enabled through the *"Alternative Status Display"* setting, which allows filtering and manual sorting of statuses by right-clicking them.
- Battered/Harried indicators can be enabled in the settings menu.

More details available [here](Features/UI.md#player-portraits).

<center>![Player Info preview.](Features/img/ui/player_info.png)</center>

### Hotbar
Epip offers a heavily improved Hotbar UI, featuring multiple bars, custom "action" buttons in the bottom left, and numerous functions to make hotbar management easier.

Press the `+`/`-` buttons by the panel in the bottom left to add/remove bars. More details on Hotbar improvements are available in its [dedicated subpage](Features/Hotbar.md).

<center>![Hotbar preview.](Features/img/hotbar/hotbar_extra_slots.png)</center>

### Vanity
Epip features an easy-to-use cosmetic item customization system, including armor transmogrification, custom color dyes, quick outfit swapping and auras, all through a new UI integrated into the character sheet.

Right-click an equipped item and select *"Vanity..."* in its context menu to get started, or learn more at the dedicated [feature page](Features/Vanity.md).

![Maddest drip, by a Cathe](img/showcase/drip.png)

### Settings Menu
Epip includes its own [Settings Menu](Features/SettingsMenu.md) UI full of options to toggle or customize its features - you may use as few or many of them as you want.

<center>![Options menu.](Features/img/settingsmenu/info_tab.png)</center>

The Epip Settings Menu also makes custom hotkeys possible, including ones for Meditate & Source Infuse (in Epic Encounters), an examine hotkey, as well as binding the 12 "action buttons" from the [Hotbar UI](Features/Hotbar.md).

### Inventory
Epip offers numerous improvements and options to keep your inventory and items convenient to use, including:

- [Multi-select controls](Features/InventoryMultiSelect.md), allowing fast operations on groups of items, even across different bags/containers.
- A brand new [Quick Find UI](Features/QuickFind.md) that shows a customizable filtered view of the party inventory to find items quicker.
- A setting has been added to enable infinite carry weight for all party members.
- A setting exists to automatically identify items, optionally not requiring any Loremaster.
- Consumable items, like mushrooms and food, no longer require you to use them once for them to show their effects in the tooltip.

### Tooltip Adjustments
Tooltips have received numerous fixes and improvements, displaying a lot of information in a clearer manner, as well as details previously unmentioned such as sources of statuses. You can read about them at their [dedicated page](Features/TooltipAdjustments.md).

<center>![A weapon tooltip showing the changes.](img/showcase/weapon_tooltip.png)</center>
<center>*A weapon tooltip showing the various tooltip additions, such as Quality, range and Masterwork indicator.*</center>

### Combat Log
A setting exists to enable various improvements to the Combat Log UI, such as:

- Filtering out individual types of messages, by right-clicking the UI to open a context menu.
- Certain messages have been reworded for clarity and can now "merge" into a single line if they happen in quick succession, improving readability.
- You clear the log from its context menu.

![Combat log filters.](img/showcase/combat_log.png)

!!! warning ""
    Combat log improvements are currently only available while playing in English.

### World Tooltips
The item tooltips that are displayed by holding ++lalt++ by default have received many options to improve their usability:

- A keybind has been added to make them toggleable, so you don't need to hold the key all the time.
- A setting exists to enable these tooltips for all items, similar to the "Let there be tooltips" mod, but with compatibility for all modded items.
    - Additional settings exist to filter out types of items you may be not interested in, such as beds, doors, lights, etc.
- You may hide these tooltips for empty looted containers and bodies.
- A setting exists that makes clicking the tooltips open containers rather than pick them up.
- You may highlight tooltips for certain kinds of items in a customizable color to distinguish them.

![Color-coded world item tooltips. Containers, equipment and consumables are all highlighted in a different, customizable color.](img/showcase/world_tooltips.png)
<center>*Color-coded world item tooltips. Containers, equipment and consumables are all highlighted in a different, customizable color.*</center>

### Quick Examine
A new "Quick Examine" UI can be opened with a custom hotkey (defaults to `V`). This panel is mainly used to show the effects enemies have from the ["Epic Enemies"](Features/EpicEncountersQoL.md#epic-enemies) feature, but it can also display the character's artifacts, skills and equipment, useful to check information of your allies in multiplayer.

![Quick Examine.](img/showcase/quick_examine.png)

## Miscellaneous
- Certain client-side vanilla issues have been fixed. You may read about them at their [dedicated page](Features/VanillaFixes.md).
- A setting exists to auto-listen to nearby dialogues, enabled from the "Notifications" tab (*"Auto-Listen Dialogues"* and *"Auto-Listen Range Limit"*).
- A setting exists to highlight empty slots in the container inventory UI upon hovering over them, for consistency with the party inventory. Can be enabled from the "Inventory" settings tab (*"Highlight Empty Container Slots"*).
