# Epip

Epip is an extensive UI and quality-of-life mod for Divinity: Original Sin 2 that introduces dozens of usability improvements to vanilla UIs, as well as numerous new custom UIs to fulfill needs the original ones cannot. See [the features section](#features) for details.

Epip implements improvements such as a larger hotbar, multi-select in inventories, equipment transmog and RGB dyes, unlocked camera and much, much more, while staying unintrusive out-of-the-box and deeply customizable.

Vast customization for Epip's features is available through an in-game [settings menu](Features/SettingsMenu.md) - you may use as many or as few features as you deem necessary, with most of them being disabled by default.

## Features
Below is a non-exhaustive list of features; I suggest browsing the latest [patchnotes](patchnotes.md) to get up to speed with latest additions. Exploring the in-game [Settings Menu](Features/SettingsMenu.md) is another good way of getting familiar with the mod's features.

!!! info "Settings Info"
    Many features are disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled from the [Settings Menu](Features/SettingsMenu.md).

    This is to make the mod less overwhelming, as well as to respect that not all of its features will appeal to every player.

## UI

### Target Health Bar
The health bar shown at the top of the screen has been reworked to look better and include more information, showing resistances, Battered/Harried in Epic Encounters, as well as AP, SP, initiative and more while holding ++lshift++ - saving you many trips to the examine UI. More details [here](Features/UI.md#target-status-bar).

<center>![Health bar alt](Features/img/ui/health_bar_shift.png)</center>

### Player Portraits
The player portraits UI has received various improvements:

- The list of statuses will now wrap onto a second row, preventing them from obscuring most of your screen.
- An improved status bar can be enabled through the *"Alternative Status Display"* setting, which allows filtering and manual sorting of statuses by right-clicking them.
- Battered/Harried indicators can be enabled in the settings menu.

More details available [here](Features/UI.md#player-portraits).

Epip features an easy-to-use cosmetic item customization system, including armor transmogrification, custom color dyes, quick outfit swapping and auras, all through a new UI integrated into the character sheet.

Right-click an equipped item and select *"Vanity..."* in its context menu to get started, or learn more at the dedicated [feature page](Features/Vanity.md).

### Settings Menu
Epip includes its own [Settings Menu](Features/SettingsMenu.md) UI full of options to toggle or customize its features - you may use as few or many of them as you want.

The Epip Settings Menu also makes custom hotkeys possible, including ones for Meditate & Source Infuse (in Epic Encounters), an examine hotkey, as well as binding the 12 "action buttons" from the [Hotbar UI](Features/Hotbar.md).

### Inventory
Epip offers numerous improvements and options to keep your inventory and items convenient to use, including:

- [Multi-select controls](Features/InventoryMultiSelect.md), allowing fast operations on groups of items, even across different bags/containers.
- A brand new [Quick Find UI](Features/QuickFind.md) that shows a customizable filtered view of the party inventory to find items quicker.
- A setting has been added to enable infinite carry weight for all party members.
- A setting exists to automatically identify items, optionally not requiring any Loremaster.
- Consumable items, like mushrooms and food, no longer require you to use them once for them to show their effects in the tooltip.

A setting exists to enable various improvements to the Combat Log UI, such as:

- Filtering out individual types of messages, by right-clicking the UI to open a context menu.
- Certain messages have been reworded for clarity and can now "merge" into a single line if they happen in quick succession, improving readability.
- You clear the log from its context menu.

    Combat log improvements are currently only available while playing in English.

### World Tooltips
The item tooltips that are displayed by holding ++lalt++ by default have received many options to improve their usability:

- A keybind has been added to make them toggleable, so you don't need to hold the key all the time.
- A setting exists to enable these tooltips for all items, similar to the "Let there be tooltips" mod, but with compatibility for all modded items.
    - Additional settings exist to filter out types of items you may be not interested in, such as beds, doors, lights, etc.
- You may hide these tooltips for empty looted containers and bodies.
- A setting exists that makes clicking the tooltips open containers rather than pick them up.
- You may highlight tooltips for certain kinds of items in a customizable color to distinguish them.

### Quick Examine
A new "Quick Examine" UI can be opened with a custom hotkey (defaults to `V`). This panel is mainly used to show the effects enemies have from the ["Epic Enemies"](Features/EpicEncountersQoL.md#epic-enemies) feature, but it can also display the character's artifacts, skills and equipment, useful to check information of your allies in multiplayer.
