# FAQ

## Where do I discuss the mod?
The Epic Encounters discord and their feedback/bugs channels are the right places.
The *#epipeline* channel there should be used for development-related discussion.

There is no "Pip discord"; its existence is a myth fabricated by a certain Subnautica fan.

## What's this talk about a gameplay mod?
Initially, Epip started out as a gameplay mod after development of EE went on hiatus, before becoming a UI & QoL mod. Gameplay changes from that era stayed in the mod for a long time due to their acceptance, but ultimately had to be split off into a separate mod for portability reasons.

The gameplay mod is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HqxEzlXaZa4AMRpCybDPvZ2IyFjAL0J0/view?usp=sharing), and its changes are documented in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10C39LndW8QwDcfA_bUpq_ZYu_6lt_vkjW7-sFeIuBKU/edit#heading=h.trnrapu9q41w). You may also get it through Mel's auto-updater.

There are no plans to work on any further gameplay changes.

## What mods does Epip work with?
Due to the nature of UI modding and the scope of the project, any other mods that alter UI will likely see problems.

The following Larian UIs currently have their .swf overwritten in Epip:

- Context Menu
- Enemy Health Bar
- Hotbar (planned to be removed)
- OptionsInput (planned to be removed)
- Overhead
- PlayerInfo (planned to be removed)
- Status Console
- Character Sheet (planned to be removed)
- Combat Log (planned to be removed)
- Panel Select

And the following have overlay UIs made for them, meaning problems will likely only arise with graphical mods to them:

- Character Sheet (for Vanity)
- Save/Load

Advancements in UI modding and our expertise have made it possible to remove a lot of .swf overrides throughout the years, but there remain older Epip UI changes that have not yet received the rewrites required to get rid of their overrides.

There's only so much that can be done in regards to Larian UI moddability however, and thus conflicts between UI mods will likely remain a problem forever. Epip does have a [solution](../Documentation/Client/UI/Generic/Introduction.md) for the problem of custom UI moddability, however.

## Can I donate?
I (Pip) don't take donations because they create pressure to deliver updates on a somewhat regular basis, which I cannot do. You can instead buy [this game I worked on](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1477950/Lazy_Galaxy_2/). It's a pretty good one within its genre too. Just keep in mind that I also worked on the UIs for it, for better or for worse.

## What does "Epip" mean?
Unknown.

Some community members have pointed out that "Epip" spelled backwards is "Pipe", however the lore implications of this have not been studied.
