Download \u00b6 Requires Norbyte's Script Extender Load after both EE Core and EE Origins. Language warning Only English is fully supported. Visit this sheet to contribute to translations. Standalone usage warning If you have the Improved Hotbar mod, you must disable it to use Epip . All of its functions are already in Epip (+ like 9 months worth of updates that the workshop mod never got). See the front page and the changelog if you're new to Epip. Latest stable version, v1065 . (07/05/23) See the patchnotes page for patchnotes. Special thanks to: Ameranth for programming help as well as the amazing moddability of EE Derpy Moa for motivation and initial ideas Norbyte for the Script Extender and it's fantastic UI features Elric for his help with designing and drawing new UIs Cathe for contributing to the feature showcases on this website Translators: Cathe & JoienReid: Russian translation Ferocidade: Brazilian Portuguese translation Features \u00b6 Below is a non-exhaustive list of features; I suggested browsing the latest patchnotes to get up to speed with latest additions. UI \u00b6 Health Bar \u00b6 The health bar at the top of the screen now shows a character\u2019s resistances as well as their Battered and Harried stacks. The B/H icons will light up if the target has enough of them to suffer a Tier 3 status, and will blink when the duration of the stacks is 1 turn or fewer. The actual B/H statuses are now hidden in this UI to reduce clutter. Credits to Elric for the new art assets used! Holding the \"show sneak cones\" button (shift by default) will replace the resistances display with the character\u2019s current AP, Source and Initiative - very handy for planning and foreseeing enemy turns. Additionally, it will lower the opacity of status effects on the health bar. The health bar above the hotbar now shows its values at all times (you needn't hover over it anymore), and the Physical/Magic Armor text is removed to improve readability. Additionally, it now features dividers every 4 AP, making it easier to see at a quick glance how much AP you've got left. It now also shows your maximum SP, and the AP/SP indicators are properly centered. Its graphics have also been improved, with the AP bar being easier to read thanks to a dropshadow. A setting has been added to show target-related information on this health bar, including source of the Taunt status, as well as whether a character is currently unpreferred or ignored by the AI. Hotbar \u00b6 Epip offers a heavily improved Hotbar UI, featuring multiple bars, custom \"action\" buttons in the bottom left, and numerous functions to make hotbar management easier. To add/remove rows, click the small +/- icons to the right of the buttons area. You can cycle each row independently through all 5 rows of slots that the game allows. You can have up to 5 rows visible. You can use the regular hotkeys (F/R by default) to cycle the bottom bar. Holding shift while using them will cycle the second row from the bottom instead. Holding Ctrl will cycle the 3rd row, while holding alt will cycle the 4th one. The buttons next to the portrait are now customizable; when your hotbar is unlocked, you can drag and drop to rearrange them. Additionally, mods can add their own \"actions\" there, and there are a few new built-in ones. You can press the middle mouse button to unbind them. Right click one of those buttons or click the ^ button to bring up a \"drawer\" with all the actions that you can drag and drop onto your actions bar. You can also click them to use them directly from there. These buttons can be used with keyboard hotkeys; to do so, you must assign keys to them from Epip's input options menu. They are labelled \"Hotbar Action #N\" there. By default, if you have 2+ rows of hotbar slots, you will also have a second row of these customizable buttons. You can disable this from the settings menu. Epip Encounters implements multiple handy new actions, in addition to some vanilla functions: Source Infuse & Meditate Toggle Minimap Resting (using a bedroll from anywhere in your party inventory - no need to find one for everyone!) Toggle Party Link (instantaneous, no animation!) Respec (if Portable Respec Mirror mod is installed) The purpose of the action bar is to provide a centralized place for modders to add shortcuts/hotkeys to their interfaces or features, eliminating the need for interactable books that clutter your inventory and freeing up space on the hotbar. Right-click a row on the hotbar to bring up a context menu where you can \"push\" groups of slots around (great for inserting spells inbetween!), clear unmemorized spells, or save \"loadouts\" to restore your hotbars in later playthroughs. Additionally, all \"engine actions\" (except for flee) are available from the vanilla actions drawer. The hotbar improvements are also available as a standalone mod with no EE dependency. Character Sheet \u00b6 The character sheet now shows physical and piercing resistances. The tags tab is replaced with a brand new \"Keywords and misc.\" tab. You can use it to quickly reference your keyword activators and mutators, as well as reaction charges remaining. Player Portraits \u00b6 The status bar on your characters now wraps onto a second row once there are more than 6 statuses, preventing it from obscuring the middle of the screen during intense fights. Summon portraits no longer show statuses and are shrunk while the status bar is wrapping. You can right-click your portraits to open a context menu where you can hide the status bar and summons, as well as access the Debug Cheats if you're in developer mode. In the settings, you may also enable a Battered/Harried display on these portraits. Settings Menu \u00b6 The settings menu has been expanded to allow mods to add their own settings. Epip includes its own tab full of options to customize its features. The input menu has received similar treatment, with custom keybindings becoming possible. You must first click the \"Controls\" tab before you can access custom keybinds added by Epip. Custom hotkeys include Meditate, Source Infuse, as well as binding the 12 \"action buttons\" from the Hotbar UI. Additionally, the difficulty can now be changed to/from tactician freely at any time. The side effects of this have not been studied well, but everything appears to work fine with the exception of already-initialized enemies having missing HP and consumables(?). Tooltip Adjustments \u00b6 \"Stat Adjustments\" in tooltips are now merged into one line. Added a label for items that have been Masterworked While infusing a spell or holding shift, skill tooltips now highlight Source Infusions you don't meet the requirements for. Holding shift also displays your relevant ability score in the tooltip. The simple small tooltips appear without a delay Skill tooltips now account for effects that increase or decrease AP costs Most statuses that deal damage now show the calculated damage, rather than showing \"(before modifiers)\" Status tooltips show who applied the status (if anyone) Tooltips for randomly generated items now show a \"quality\" label, which indicates how good the damage/armor rolls were for that item. A 100% quality indicates the best roll, possibly only on divine items. The word \"Set:\" has been removed from tooltips due to confusion and redundancy. Deltamods that previously did not show clearly in tooltips (+range, +elemental damage) now have blue labels in tooltips, like others. Holding shift will cause skill tooltips to display damage multipliers instead. Does not work for all skills. Removed the skull icon introduced by GB5 that appeared on negative status effects Added a keybind to scroll tooltips The damage tooltip in the character sheet has been made less confusing by removing the mention of damage from gear and dummied out LW values. Additionally, it now makes it clear that the weapon abilities grant multiplicative damage increases. Books that have been read and keys that have been used now have a green label in their tooltip. Artifacts display with a special rarity and item color, hand-picked by the EE devs. This change has been made available in the base EE mod as well. Additionally, artifact runes now show a \"Cannot equip.\" warning for slots that they are incompatible with. Tooltips for damaging statuses now display the damage they will deal approximately, rather than showing the base damage before any modifiers. Long item tooltips will try to fit the screen better, eliminating the issue of being unable to compare items while wielding a heavily upgraded item. In developer mode, statuses and skills show their IDs in their tooltips. Inventory \u00b6 A setting has been added to enable infinite carry weight for all party members. You can also enable automatic identifying of items, optionally not requiring any Loremaster. Consumable items, like mushrooms and food, no longer require you to use them once for them to show their effects in the tooltip. Treasure Display \u00b6 An option has been added to display noteworthy item drops of enemies and containers on their health bar. For characters, this only shows while holding shift. Combat Log \u00b6 You may now filter out individual types of messages in the combat log by right-clicking it. Certain messages have been reworded for clarity and can now \"merge\" if they happen in quick succession, improving readability. You can also clear the log from the context menu. World Tooltips \u00b6 A keybind has been added to make world item tooltips toggleable, so you don't need to hold alt all the time. Additionally, a setting exists to disable these tooltips for empty containers and bodies. Rewards UI \u00b6 An option has been added to allow viewing the character sheet while within the quest rewards screen, allowing you to compare rewards to your party's currently equipped items. Overhead Text and Notifications \u00b6 Settings have been added to shorten the duration of overhead text, and to change their size (as well as the size of damage numbers). Notifications from characters casting skills in combat are repositioned to show above the hotbar, so as not to obscure the enemy health bars. They can also be disabled in the settings. Additionally, you can change the duration of the area transition labels, or disable them entirely. Skillbook \u00b6 You can now unlearn skills by right-clicking them in the skillbook while out of combat. Innate skills cannot be unlearnt. Crafting \u00b6 The crafting UI now remembers your previous tab, instead of always defaulting to showing all items - this is helpful for using the Greatforge. Additionally, you can set the default tab of the UI in the settings menu. Gift Bags and mod incompatibilities \u00b6 Gift bag mods incompatible with EE are no longer selectable, to prevent regrets. Gift bags that work but for one reason or another are undesirable show a warning upon attempting to enable them. Common mods incompatible with EE now show a warning when you load into the game with them enabled, once per playthrough. Quick Examine \u00b6 A \"Quick Examine\" panel can be opened with a custom hotkey (defaults to V ). This panel is mainly used to show the effects enemies have from the \"Epic Enemies\" feature, but it also displays the character's artifacts, useful to check your ally's effects in multiplayer. More information will be added to this panel in the future. Examine \u00b6 The Examine UI now shows Critical Chance, and can be configured to open on the sides of the screen instead of the center. Additionally, there is now a keybind to open the examine menu. Ingame Patchnotes \u00b6 A new journal UI can be accessed from the Hotbar actions, or after updating the mod. It lists the patchnotes of Epip, and other mods can add information/patchnotes there freely as well. Updating the mod will also show a prompt to open the UI. Chat \u00b6 Chat commands are added, beginning with a slash (/). The following commands exist: /rp : shows a message over your current character's head. Great for role-playing. /emote : plays an animation for your current character. Use /help emote to see all emotes. /help : shows all commands, or help for a particular command. Save/Load UI \u00b6 An alphabetical sorting option as well as a search bar can be enabled in the options for the save/load UI. Ascension/Meditate \u00b6 Ascension \u00b6 You can now use the Esc key to go back to the previous page in the Ascension UI, or exit it if you're on the default page. An option exists to make this key always exit the UI. An \"Immersive Meditation\" setting can be enabled to hide the minimap and hotbar while within the EE UIs. Greatforge Context Menus \u00b6 Item context menus now have options to quickly dismantle items, as well as to remove their runes. Doing so still costs the usual amount of gold/splinters respectively. Containers with equipment in them get a \"Mass Dismantle\" option, letting you rapidly dismantle unwanted gear. Greatforge \u00b6 An option to add sockets to items (\"Drill Sockets\") has been added. This does not allow you to break the 2 socket limit for one-handed weaponry. The Empower option now properly scales armor values, however this will only take effect after a save+reload. Additionally, an option to rename items (\"Engrave\") has been added. This is purely cosmetic. Epic Enemies \u00b6 Epic Enemies is a randomizer feature enabled from the ingame settings menu. It bestows enemies with EE perks such as keyword activators/mutators, artifacts, and more. You can configure the relative chance of each effect being rolled on enemies. These effects will be applied to enemies when they enter combat. You may use the \"Quick Examine\" feature to view the perks that each enemy rolled; see its respective section in this site for more info. Vanity \u00b6 Easy to use cosmetic customization system, including armor transmogrification, custom RGB dyes, quick outfit swapping and auras. Wanna drip as hard as this? Learn more at the dedicated feature page . Miscellaneous Bug Fixes and Adjustments \u00b6 Certain vanilla issues have been fixed: Summons dying in combat (or being newly spawned) no longer causes your current character to be deselected You can now walk into corpses in combat without looting them; you can hold shift if you need to pillage them mid-fight, or disable this in the settings Miscellaneous Gameplay Changes \u00b6 Epip features some minor changes to the base EE gameplay. These are a remnant from before the mod switched to focusing on UX, and will be split off into a separate mod in the future. You can read about them in the old doc. Planned for the future \u00b6 Proper controller support for EE UIs (meditate) Sorting and filtering statuses on the player portraits Inventory improvements: custom filtering and sorting, along with multi-select For developers \u00b6 Epip is built using numerous libraries, making client-side scripting and UI modding easier. This site's documentation of them is heavily WIP. Every UI touched by Epip has a lua table with wrapper APIs to manipulate it. Additionally, multiple utility libraries are available: Client : contains queries relating to the client. Client.UI : holds all UI tables; too many to list individually, below are the most noteworthy ones. Client.UI.MessageBox : allows you to open your own message boxes, which may also prompt for user string input. Client.UI.ContextMenu : allows creating custom context menus, with numerous new types of elements and support for nested menus. Warning: it's a very old API and does not hold up to current standards. A rewrite is pending. Client.Flash : contains utility methods for handling Flash elements from lua. Client/Server.lua : allows registering osiris symbol listeners from the client. Osiris : provides a cleaner way of working with Osiris symbols: allows passing of extender entity objects in place of GUIDs, returning from user queries, and unpacking DB query results. Character , Item : libraries with numerous utility functions for the related entity types. Text : utility methods for working with text, featuring a super-versatile Format function for dealing with those pesky html font tags. Timer : self-explanatory. Also supports tick-based timers. Coroutine : improved coroutine table, with the ability to sleep coroutines, either for a certain amount of time or until a condition is met. Color , Vector : utilities for dealing with colors and vectors. Client.UI.Generic : allows for the creation of UIs using only lua. Work-in-progress (well, everything here is, in a way). Epip : main mod table, containing registered Features. Developer Features \u00b6 Debug Cheats \u00b6 If the extender developer mode is available, a cheats context menu is added to characters, with numerous handy functions like: Copying GUID to clipboard Teleporting Kill/resurrect Next-gen godmode (\"Pipmode\"), with infinite AP and 0 skill cooldowns Adding Flexstats, ExtendedStats, attributes/abilities, skills, statuses and more Spawning all artifacts, or specific treasure tables or templates Debug Display \u00b6 In developer mode, a UI widget with FPS, TPS and mod version info can be enabled from the settings. This widget can be dragged around. Debug Menu \u00b6 In developer mode, a menu with debugging options for Features can be opened using a keybind (defaults to LCtrl + F). You can use it to change logging levels, disable features, and run tests. Your logging/debug settings are persistent. AI Logging \u00b6 An option exists to log AI scoring to the console. Console Commands \u00b6 A few miscellaneous console commands are added: !bruteforceuitypes : client-side; attempts to find the TypeIDs of all UIs currently instanced, including custom ones !soundtest : client-side; plays all the sounds defined in the UI sounds lsx and shows their name. Useful for inspiration. !animtest : server-side; plays all human female animations on the currently controlled character. Cannot be interrupted once started! !worryaboutsuchsmallthings : tests the performance between EsvCharacter:HasTag() and Osi.IsTagged() !testactionhandles : tests string handles for \"actions\" from the Stats library.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#epip-encounters","text":"Epip Encounters is an add-on mod for Epic Encounters 2 which introduces numerous Quality of Life changes as well as UI improvements.","title":"Epip Encounters"},{"location":"#download","text":"Requires Norbyte's Script Extender Load after both EE Core and EE Origins.

Osiris : provides a cleaner way of working with Osiris symbols: allows passing of extender entity objects in place of GUIDs, returning from user queries, and unpacking DB query results. Character , Item : libraries with numerous utility functions for the related entity types. Text : utility methods for working with text, featuring a super-versatile Format function for dealing with those pesky html font tags. Timer : self-explanatory. Also supports tick-based timers. Coroutine : improved coroutine table, with the ability to sleep coroutines, either for a certain amount of time or until a condition is met. Color , Vector : utilities for dealing with colors and vectors. Client.UI.Generic : allows for the creation of UIs using only lua. Work-in-progress (well, everything here is, in a way).

We've heard your complaints about the decision to remove gameplay changes from 2021, and have made the decision to preserve them through a future, separate add-on. To make up for all the drama, we are happy to present a new gameplay-oriented patch, the first one since 2021 ! We know the rune crafting system has been underwhelming for years now, which is why this patch introduces a brand new system just for them. It consumes more materials, but should be far more engaging and rewarding. Simply right-click a rune material and select the new option in the dropdown menu to get started. This patch contains numerous other gameplay and balance changes, as well as the usual dose of UI stuff: Removed innate skill slots; slots for memorizing skills can now only be obtained through the memory attribute, so as to increase its value This change only applies to new playthroughs so as not to screw up your loadout Wands now have a chance to appear with the \"Shuffle\" modifier, causing their spells to cycle in random order Added a new talent, \"Trickster's Repertoire\", initially featured in the hit videogame \"Darby's EE2 Tweaks\": With Trickster's Repertoire, you sneak and become invisible for free at the start of combat, until the start of your first turn. At the end of your turn in subsequent rounds, sneak for free. You always stop sneaking at the start of turns. Additionally, your special arrows count as basic attacks and you have a 33% chance to recover a special arrow after shooting it. Used those 2 fancy triangle rulers to straighten the character sheet a bit Animation Cancelling is now 100% client-side, slightly faster, and works with some spells that had issues before (ex. arrow spray, staff of magus, barrage) Let us know if this buff is too much Vanity dyes now scale with finesse instead of wits The health bar when you hover over a character now displays health and armor values Added Shigeru Miyamoto as a secret recruitable party member Added 2 new types of fishing rods from vanilla that were previously unused/unobtainable Changed how hotbar row count and visibility is saved This might not work in multiplayer due to extender shenanigans Changing rows in the hotbar now deals 10% of your max health as damage, per stack of elementalist Statuses in the status bar are now sorted in the order that they are sorted Removed the \"cinematic combat\" option Buffed the lizard bust slider from 0.5x to 0.75x (+ 0.1x per Entropy embodied) Removed some april fools stuff, we're not joking around anymore Fixes: Non-english languages should no longer have broken artifact descriptions The cause was fetching the TSKs during module load, which causes a bug that overwrites the string. Fixed Quick Examine not being openable for the same character twice in a row Fixed vanity dyes not applying to slots that vanilla armor (without transmog) would hide/mask Fixed error if an item was transmogged into a template that no longer existed On the technical side of things: Reworked the doc generation script again; the doc appearance has changed considerably, and now supports hotlinking to functions Added support for multiple inheritance to classes made with the OOP library Generic UIs can be fetched by string ID now (oops) Added Character.Events.ItemEquipped Updated the Generic example script and documentation Net payloads now have methods to fetch the associated character and/or item Added Osiris.GetFirstFact() Added new calls to CharacterLib: IsOrigin() , IsPlayer() Small changes to annotations and rewrites of code that was using deprecated stuff Began work on a new cheats system and UI Added Client.IsCursorOverUI() and Client.GetActiveUI() Added Input.IsTextFieldFocused() Added skillstate-related methods to CharacterLib Reworked hotbar prepared/casting skill checks to not require server information Added Client.Events.SkillStateChanged","title":"Beta Versions"},{"location":"beta/#1423-upload-old","text":"Epip Encounters is now 2 years old!

Since late 2021, the focus of development has shifted to making the internals of the mod available as libraries, aiming to provide utility, better maintainability, extendability and easy manipulation of UIs from lua. The ultimate goal is to make the mod easy for someone else to continue working on after/if I depart - EE is an overhaul built to last and be tinkered with, and I would like to honor that in my own project. This change will be a long process. There are still many features of the mod that remain to be rewritten to the new standards and methodology, or extended to provide functionality beyond what the current mod needs. Anything that is documented here is considered stable and unlikely to change drastically - any changes to these calls/systems will be mentioned in future patch notes. The definitions here are auto-generated from EmmyLua annotations within the scripts (using update_docs.py found in the mod). Functions are tagged through @meta to denote tags like \"Client-only\", \"EE-only\". Declaring these at the top of the file tags all functions in the file. Introduction \u00b6 The mod's root table contains the following tables: Epip : stores references to \"Features\" and metadata related to the mod. Game : contains libraries for querying information of characters, items and other contexts relating to the game. Client : contains client-specific calls as well as tables offering UI-specific calls, events and hooks. Utilities : contains utility methods useful across many contexts. The scripting in Epip Encounters focuses on event-driven programming. Aside from functions, systems and features tend to implement events and hooks which allow other scripts to react to them being raised. Event listeners allow you to react to events sent from scripts. They can receive parameters and are executed in the order that they were registered. -- Listen for the shift key being pressed/unpressed. Client.Input:RegisterListener(\"SneakConesToggled\", function(pressed) print(\"Sneak cones toggled: \" .. pressed) end) Hooks are similar to event listeners, but are used to modify values calculated within functions. Their purpose is to allow scripts to alter the logic or output of functions. A hook is always passed a \"default value\" as its first parameter, which will be used if no listeners choose to act upon the event. Any script can implement events/hooks, and it's easy to add \"parameters\" to registering listeners as well, to filter their execution conditonally. -- Set opacity for Battered/Harried stack backgrounds in the health bar based on if the amount if enough to inflict a T3. Client.UI.EnemyHealthBar:RegisterHook(\"GetStackOpacity\", function(opacity, stack, amount) local threshold = Game.Character.GetStacksNeededToInflictTier3(Client.GetCharacter()) if amount >= threshold then opacity = 1 elseif amount == 0 then opacity = 0.5 else opacity = 0.75 end return opacity end) Hooks are not limited to changing primitives, they are often also used in UI scripts to allow for manipulation of the data that the engine is passing it, parsed into handy tables. The following example adds Critical Chance to the Examine UI. -- Add Critical Chance to the examine menu when its data is being updated. Client.UI.Examine:RegisterHook(\"Update\", function(examineData) local char = Client.UI.Examine.GetCharacter() -- Only do this for characters being examined if char then local critEntry = { id = 9, label = \"Critical Chance\", iconID = Client.UI.Examine.ICONS.CRITICAL_CHANCE, value = string.format(\"%d%%\", char.Stats.CriticalChance), type = Client.UI.Examine.ENTRY_TYPES.STAT, } -- Insert crit chance after damage local damageElement,damageIndex,damageCategory = examineData:GetElement(4, 6) examineData:InsertElement(damageCategory.id, critEntry, damageIndex + 1) end return examineData end) Aliases \u00b6 The following EmmyLua aliases are defined (in EpipIdeHelpers.lua ): ---@alias Entity EclCharacter | EsvCharacter | EclItem | EsvItem ---@alias Character EsvCharacter | EclCharacter ---@alias Item EclItem | EsvItem ---@alias EquipSlot \"Helmet\" | \"Breast\" | \"Leggings\" | \"Weapon\" | \"Shield\" | \"Ring\" | \"Belt\" | \"Boots\" | \"Gloves\" | \"Amulet\" | \"Ring\" | \"Ring2\" | \"Horns\" | \"Overhead\" ---@alias EquipmentSubType \"Platemail\" | \"Robes\" | \"Leather\" | \"Belt\" | \"Ring\" | \"Amulet\" | \"Shield\" | \"Dagger\" | \"Sword\" | \"Axe\" | \"Mace\" | \"Sword\" | \"Spear\" | \"Staff\" | \"Bow\" | \"Crossbow\" | \"Wand\" ---@alias StackType \"Battered\" | \"B\" | \"Harried\" | \"H\" ---@alias Gender \"Male\" | \"Female\" ---@alias Race \"Human\" | \"Elf\" | \"Dwarf\" | \"Lizard\" ---@alias Keyword \"ViolentStrike\" | \"VitalityVoid\" | \"Predator\" | \"Elementalist\" | \"Prosperity\" | \"Paucity\" | \"IncarnateChampion\" | \"Defiance\" | \"Occultist\" | \"Disintegrate\" | \"Wither\" | \"Centurion\" | \"Abeyance\" | \"Benevolence\" | \"Presence\" | \"Ward\" | \"Celestial\" | \"Purity\" | \"VolatileArmor\" | \"Voracity\" ---@alias KeywordBoonType \"Activator\" | \"Mutator\" -- For doc generation; does not actually work in IDE ---@class Event ---@class Hook --------------------------------------------- -- UI --------------------------------------------- ---@alias MessageBoxType \"Message\" | \"Input\" --------------------------------------------- -- GAME.TOOLTIP --------------------------------------------- ---@class TooltipData ---@field Data table[] ---@param data table[] ---@return TooltipData function TooltipData:Create(data) end ---@param type string ---@return table function TooltipData:GetElement(type) end ---@param type string ---@return table[] function TooltipData:GetElements(type) end ---@param type string function TooltipData:RemoveElements(type) end ---@param type string function TooltipData:RemoveElement(type) end ---@param ele table function TooltipData:AppendElement(ele) end ---@param ele table ---@param appendAfter table function TooltipData:AppendElementAfter(ele, appendAfter) end","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"docs/#documentation","text":"The features of Epip Encounters are built on top of a lot of trial-and-error research and work on client-side scripting and UI modding.

Standalone usage warning If you have the Improved Hotbar mod, you must disable it to use Epip . All of its functions are already in Epip (+ like 9 months worth of updates that the workshop mod never got). See the front page and the changelog if you're new to Epip. Download here . With this version, EE has been removed as a dependency. It's now possible to use Epip in a non-EE playthrough and the main features will work. There may be quirks that need ironing out, ex. references to features or settings that only make sense in EE - please report these. This also means that the remaining gameplay changes have been removed. If you wish to keep them, use this mod . The following patchnotes are the merged patchnotes of all beta versions of the patch, excluding the April Fools one. By the way, due to logistics changes, you will have to re-enable immersive meditation in the settings, if you had it on. Animation cancelling now has 2 modes: client-side (v1065 behaviour) and server-side (old behaviour). The server-side option uses the lower delay that was used previously. Changed how hotbar row count and visibility is saved This might not work in multiplayer due to extender shenanigans Custom status UI elements are now bigger (ex. in Quick Examine) Added a new rune crafting system; simply right-click a rune material and select the new option in the dropdown menu to get started. Reworked the stats tab; should be less prone to bugging out in multiplayer now Also fixed the gold & splinter stat The incompatible mods warnings now show on every load, rather than once per playthrough Updated localizations and added Brazilian Portuguese, translated by Ferocidade Character sheet skew during anniversaries is now less extreme Removed the \"cinematic combat\" option Fixes: Fixed some log spam related to status icons Fixed hotbar loadouts not working Non-english languages should no longer have broken artifact descriptions The cause was fetching the TSKs during module load, which causes a bug that overwrites the string. Fixed Quick Examine not being openable for the same character twice in a row Fixed vanity dyes not applying to slots that vanilla armor (without transmog) would hide/mask Fixed error if an item was transmogged into a template that no longer existed Fixed a typo in the settings to fix Astrologer's Gaze tooltip On the technical side of things: Added ActionReleased event to Input library Added GetIcon() to BatteredHarried library Added GetLevelID() to Entity library Largely decoupled the logic for custom keybinds away from the UI itself (onto InputLib) Added EpicEncounters.DeltaMods library with dynamically-generated data about EE deltamods Added DragDropStateChanged event to Pointer lib Equipped artifacts are now tracked using UserVars instead of tags Generic: Added RepositionElements() to Grid Added Destroy() to UI instances Fixes and additions to PlayerInfo methods Moved various functionality from Feature up to its parent class Library (UserVars, ModVars) Fixed some warning spam related to status icons Various new checks to disable EE features when playing vanilla Fixed setting ID conflict issues in the settings menu Various fixes to debug cheats Reworked the doc generation script again; the doc appearance has changed considerably, and now supports hotlinking to functions Added support for multiple inheritance to classes made with the OOP library Generic UIs can be fetched by string ID now (oops) Added Character.Events.ItemEquipped Updated the Generic example script and documentation Net payloads now have methods to fetch the associated character and/or item Added Osiris.GetFirstFact() Added new calls to CharacterLib: IsOrigin() , IsPlayer() Small changes to annotations and rewrites of code that was using deprecated stuff Began work on a new cheats system and UI Added Client.IsCursorOverUI() and Client.GetActiveUI() Added Input.IsTextFieldFocused() Added skillstate-related methods to CharacterLib Reworked hotbar prepared/casting skill checks to not require server information Added Client.Events.SkillStateChanged v1064 - 05/03/23 \u00b6 Download here . Requires extender v58+. Quick Examine improvements: Added display for AP, SP, and initiative Added resistances display Added numerous settings: opacity, width/height, hiding certain widgets. You can find them in a new tab in the settings menu Minor graphical touch-ups Added a setting to set the default position of the UI; this position will be used after reloading Added a statuses bar (toggleable) Added a light stroke to the resistances text Added a B/H display, with buffered damage towards the next stack Now shows your ally's skills and their cooldowns Tooltips will show the damage as if they were used by them, but Epip features (like viewing which source infusions are available) likely do not work properly currently Reworked the settings menu and underlying system Your previous setting values will be lost The settings menu is now separate from the vanilla UI, prevent conflicts with mods that may overwrite the vanilla one Settings have been reorganized into separate tabs Settings are now saved per-profile, in Osiris Data/Epip/{profile GUID}/ In the settings menu, the current tab's button is now highlighted (replicating vanilla behaviour) Reworked the settings menu to be more easily expandable and changed the appearance of settings Tabs with a large amount of options (ex. Epic Enemies) might suffer stutters while opening them, similar to Quick Find. This is an issue with the UI framework that will be investigated later. Added a new UI that shows a filtered view of the party inventory Opened with Ctrl+F by default (configurable in input menu) Can filter equipment by slot, consumables by scrolls/grenades/potions, and skillbooks by school Weapons and armor can be filtered by type (ex. sword, leather armor...) Equipment can be searched by their stat boosts (supports only vanilla modifiers for now) Right-click an equipped item to open the UI with filters set to that item's slot, to quickly replace gear Vanity internals have been reworked, with multiple changes as a result: Dyes no longer require deltamods and thus should no longer be lost to shenanigans or bloat the savefile Transmogrifying no longer requires the item to be transformed and therefore should no longer have any gameplay side effects As a result, you are no longer prevented from transmogrifying GB5 sets Transmogrifying weapons into another type (ex. dagger -> bow) will have them show in the proper location while sheathed Added an option to keep the icon while transmogrifying Fixed an issue with dyes not being loaded properly from oufits Added an option to hide any armor slot's visuals Due to an engine quirk, changing visibility is not properly reflected in the character sheet until you switch characters Removed support for vanity dyes from before v1063; items still using them will appear purple Added an \"Auras\" tab to Vanity, where you can apply visual effects to your character, onto various bones Added an option for animation-cancelling for player characters A new setting exists to blacklist skills from being affected. A more user-friendly way of adding entries will be added in a future version Added a setting that controls how character level is displayed in the health bar; defaults to current behaviour (below bar, when holding shift). Includes the option to hide the level entirely. Reworked the \"show minimap\" setting; should be more reliable now You can now drag + drop items onto the Greatforge socket \"Status effects\" in the vanilla examine UI is now capitalized, for consistency with the rest of the headers Began removing gameplay changes from original versions of Epip. Since the focus of the mod has changed over to UI and QoL, gameplay changes no longer make sense within the project, and impede it from being used without EE. Removed changes to Battle Stomp, Bless, Circle of Protection, Escapist, Siphon Poison, Summon Soul Wolf, Wolf Howl, Break the Shackles Removed changes to Elementalist damage Removed changes to Leper Reverted stat changes to Boneshaped Crusher and Soul Wolf Removed Sight and Hearing FlexStat entries Clicking a status on a player portrait or Quick Examine will now center the camera on the status's source (if any) \"Copy identifier\" keybind no longer copies template GUID Added Russian translation by Cathe & JoienReid Currently only spans the settings menu and some vanity features Since playing in non-English currently has certain issues with add-ons, a new setting has been added to display text from Epip in a language different than the game's. Level-up progress in character sheet is now shown with a percentage Added settings for disabling most of the tooltip adjustments Epip offers Surface tooltips should be more reliable Combat log improvements are now enabled by default Enemy health bar now uses a vanilla-ish appearance if EE is disabled (no fancy gargoyle boss frame) B/H indicators in player portraits are now only shown in combat (instead of when unsheathed) and are disabled if EE is disabled Removed the meme loading screen option Skill tooltips for zone-type skills no longer erroneously say their range is increased by Astrologer's Gaze Fixes: Fixed icons on the minimap flickering Fixed layouts being saved for summons and party followers Layouts should now be synchronized better in multiplayer, and survive a lua reset Layouts now save when the pause menu is opened, rather than when the game is paused (which basically never happens in multiplayer) There's probably a dozen other features that made this mistake; they will be fixed in the future Fixed the \"points available\" blip in the character sheet not being hidden when within vanity, if you had a lot of tabs registered Fixed the draggable area of Quick Examine being smaller than intended Fixed QuickExamine not being draggable all the way to the right of the screen Fixed the \"Epip Settings\" button not appearing on all tabs of the vanilla settings menu Fixed Trickster's Repertoire unsneaking characters that do not have the talent Fixed developer-only settings being visible outside of developer mode Hotbar: fixed hotkeys settings being deleted in some cases Disabled the save/load improvements during game over to fix a softlock (no known workaround) Fixed tooltips of player portraits and XP bar not working properly Due to engine jank, these will not be affected by the delay settings Fixed engine actions (attack, flee, etc.) being draggable to hotbar hotkeys Fixed some small visual bugs with the enemy health bar Fixed some small visual issues with custom item slots in UIs Fixed some console log spam Fixed hit chance not displaying when hovering over characters in combat Fixed some items being grayed out in hotbar groups Fixed \"immersive meditation\" and other EE UI features not working for characters that have been transformed Fixed unique items being dismantle-able with \"mass dismantle\" Fixed item context menus being misreported as character menus if you hovered over a character recently Possibly fixes the issue of options like \"mass dismantle\" not appearing The \"infinite carry weight setting\" should now work properly for clients that join mid-session Other features that face problems in multiplayer are possibly suffering from the same bug and will be fixed in the future Fixed transmogged helmets not being toggleable from the character sheet UI Fixed \"revert appearance\" in vanity not working properly On the technical side of things: Added an Image library with PNG decoding Added ImageViewer feature, intended for displaying results of images decoded with Image Improved reliability of Client.GetMousePosition() (replaced with Ext implementation) Added a Set data structure Added Vector.ScalarProduct() Added a Color element to Generic Added ClearElements() to Generic's Grid Added SetVisible() to Generic elements Added Set and Map settings types Added a debug hotkey for copying the pointer's world position Added a Interfaces library for common interfaces Generic: fixed ScrollList not supporting centering of elements Generic: added LabelledIcon prefab QuickExamine: added Widget interface StatsLib: added data of immunites TooltipLib: added support for status tooltips QuickExamine: split up some parts of BasicInfo into separate widgets Generic: fix downsizing IggyIcon Generic: added a Status prefab, for displaying status effects TooltipLib: added ShowStatusTooltip() Moved various functionality from EnemyHealthBar to a feature (EnemyHealthBarExtraInfo) Fixed TextLib's Format() not accepting decimal text sizes Added a setting to simulate EE being disabled (applies to Epip scripts only) Removed checks for Improved Hotbar mod Added an event for statuses being applied to CharacterLib Added a feature to generate Osiris event annotations for lua The IDE annotations folder in Epip has been updated to include them This might be expanded to support PROCs and QRYs later Added an OOP library for working with classes Feature now supports registering and fetching class tables in an elegant manner Started splitting up Feature into 2 classes to fix interface segregation violation Fixed OsirisLib calls not working with 0 parameters Various script cleanups (mostly for Hotbar and EnemyHealthBar) Added TSKs for older settings Changed TSK integration in Feature: the keys are no longer required to be a handle; they can be any string, letting you index the TranslatedStrings table with auto-completion TSK objects now have a GetString() method to resolve them TSK table within Feature will be deprecated soon Added a feature to play client-side effects upon hovering over entities Added libraries for EE-related mechanics (BatteredHarried, SourceInfusion), and moved relevant methods to them Fixed Character.GetEquippedItems() not returning the advertised type Added a DatabaseSync feature for synchronizing database contents to the client Might be merged into the osiris library in the future Added a UserVars library, with Feature integration Added support for function signatures without bodies to the doc generator, fixed subclasses not being detected properly Added methods related to drag-drop to PointerLib Generic: Moved annotations to separate file, solving various IDE warnings Added support for tweening Fixed Stats.MeetsRequirements() not working with attribute requirements Added ShowItemTooltip() to Tooltip lib Generic: The HotbarSlot prefab is a now more general-purpose inventory-like slot, showing rarity, rune slots, and with options to block drag-and-drop Fixed culling issues with IggyIcon Added support for scrollRects ComboBox events now throw their option ID instead of just index Added SetChildIndex() Removed swf overrides for textDisplay and notification UIs, as well as cleaned up their respective lua scripts Fixed error messages from using keys the game doesn't support (ex. media keys) Added annotations for basic stats objects Added AMER_Loot_CallistoAnomaly icon - special thanks to Elric Fixed UserVars not synchronizing Fixed GameState.IsLoading() not working Various changes to annotations Features can now declare which game states they should be enabled with, which will cause :IsEnabled() to return false under unsupported states Rewrote Osiris table. Tuples returned from DB queries are now an object and it's possible to distinguish DBs/QRYs with the same name but different arity Rewrote Item.GetEquipmentSubtype() to be a lot more reliable, and fixed it failing to identify clubs Generic: added the Texture element Generic: added more prefabs for \"form elements\", and added inheritance to them Unsubscribing event listeners with an ID that is not subscribed no longer triggers a warning Added IDE annotations for the global Ext functions (like _C() ) Added a \"DefaultTable\" data structure (inspired by python's defaultdict; a table with a default value when indexing) Removed UI override for the settings menu (LeaderLib menu might work now? no promises) Debug menu now supports fiddling with the UI scripts to an extent Osiris table now parses parameters for DB set/delete operations InputLib: added methods to fetch game input event definitions and bindings The ancient script previously used to do this has been removed, along with some other redundant ones Improvements to the doc generation script (which shall debut here soon); it can now export \"subclasses\" of a class (the auxiliary data structs) Added a generic developer input binding for hooking quick tests onto it TooltipLib: added a way to render custom formatted tooltips TooltipLib: added a method to render skill tooltips, as if the engine were doing it Minor cleanups of some scripts Fixed iggy icons in Slot elements being culled out for Generic UIs Added methods to check if a component is an item/char to EntityLib You can now specify a player index when using methods in PointerLib (though I do not know in which scenario multiple pointers can exist; splitscreen co-op perhaps?) The localization system now supports contextual metadata for ease of translation, and integration for it has been added to the Feature table You can define TSKs in TranslatedStrings and query them by indexing TSK within the feature TSKs defined this way support aliases that are valid only within the context of the feature, preventing collisions Added a python script to import/export Epip translation files in Mods\\EpipEncounters_7d32cb52-1cfd-4526-9b84-db4867bf9356\\Story\\RawFiles\\Python\\localization.py Added GetTurnOrder() to Combat library Added Client.WorldPositionToScreen() Improvements to doc generator script: Added support for net messages Better support for hooks/events Private methods are now hidden Symbols are now sorted by context (first Shared, then Client, then Server) Can now be used externally (importable) Added support for overloads v1063 - 19/09/22 \u00b6 If \"Unfocus after sending messages\" is enabled, holding shift while sending a chat message will keep the chat focused Fixed settings not saving if you didn't visit the camera settings tab On the technical side of things: Added operator overload annotations for RGBColor , Vector Vector.Create() accepts an existing array as a parameter (only one) Added TSK-related methods to Text This includes a localization system for strings in scripts; you can generate templates for localizing with Text.GenerateLocalizationTemplate() and they will be loaded from Mods/MyMod_MyGuid/Localization/Epip/MyTargetLanguage/ModTable.json , where ModTable is the mod table whose strings you've localized using the template Support for this within Epip will be added throughout future updates; currently only some camera settings support this You can generate fresh GUIDs or TSK handles with !guid and !tskhandle commands (on client context); they'll be copied to the clipboard v1062 - 16/09/22 \u00b6 Surface tooltips with an owner now show a hint regarding how the damage scales \"Active Defense\" statuses (ex. Empyrean Tears) now show remaining charges EE rune materials now show how to use them to craft runes Added a setting to configure the delay of simple tooltips appearing This affects tooltips of items in the world, as well as label tooltips in UIs (these 2 types are individually configurable) Added a settings tab for camera settings You can change the maximum zoom out distance, as well as the view angles Items in the quest reward screen now show a hint regarding modifier generation Added new Greatforge graphics for Engrave - special thanks to Cathe and Elric! Fixed a vanilla bug with the character sheet that caused the second ring slot to not play equip animations Additionally, the graphics involved should now be better centered Re-added the option to auto-unlock inventories Changing the lock status should also be synched better now - the vanilla game seems to struggle with this leading to the changes often not being properly reflected in other player's UIs Fixed weapon range deltamods only considering the first deltamod of that kind found This same fix is applied for weapon elemental damage mods as well On the technical side of things: Replaced Client.GetCharacter() implementation with a new one from v57 that doesn't rely on any UIs. Let me know if something character-involved breaks as a result (though I haven't experienced any difference). Added a Camera library Added an Entity library, with shorthands for GetGameObject() and functions to get all characters/items on a level Added limited alpha support to RGBColor (I don't think alpha is used anywhere in scripting though) Item.GetIcon() is now fully reimplemented following engine code Stats library now also holds dynamically generated data of runes, except framed ones Tooltip library now supports item tooltips and simple tooltips (the usual showTooltip call), and offers additional contextual data (ex. skill ID for skill tooltips) Started work on a new UI-independent settings library with per-profile settings support; not yet used v1061 - 4/09/22 \u00b6 Added new settings for world item tooltips: Emphasizing containers, consumables and/or equipment by changing their color This setting will not work for items that would result in a crime upon interaction; they will remain red. Enabling world tooltips for all items (similar to the \"Let there be tooltips\" mod) Filtering out clutter (particularly the one added by the setting above): chairs, doors, non-interactable items Option to open containers upon clicking their tooltip, rather than picking them up Added an option to exit the chat UI after sending a message (so you don't need to press escape manually) Added an option to disable notifications for sharing civils (\"X shares Loremaster/LC with Z\") Searching saves is now case-insensitive Added a ping counter to the debug display Since the server only responds to net messages once per game tick, the counter will basically always show around 33ms in singleplayer Fixed \"Show empty containers/bodies\" not actually working on items Fixed another case of an infinite loop of switching characters Fixed the \"toggle world tooltips\" keybind not working (+ crashing the game) Fixed some character sheet tooltips appearing in the vanity UI On the technical side of things: Osiris library now converts boolean values to integer in calls Added HasFlag() , IsContainer() to Item library Added initial groundwork for an inventory expansion v1060 - 3/09/22 \u00b6 Added a better frame for the hotbar health bar, and shadows for the AP bar (thanks Elric) Added a keybind to bring up the examine UI (the real one) Added all engine actions (the ones you see in the controller UI) to the hotbar actions drawer (the vanilla one, bound to X ), except for flee Reordered some keybindings Added \"Let there be tooltips\" to the list of EE-incompatible mods Fixed character-specific context menus appearing on items Fixed the save/load overlay not disappearing in multiplayer when the UI is closed Fixed a possible edge case with walking over corpses in combat that would result in the corpse not being lootable after combat Fixed the dragging area for the debug display being too large Fixed an issue with character control switching rapidly Fixed hotbar tooltips not showing keybinds Removed the \"Special Binding 1 & 2\" keys since they are no longer used On the technical side of things: Added data for all InputEvents to Input as well as possibly the world's biggest alias Added an IO table Began modernizing the context menu APIs Added a Pointer library, currently deals only with Ext.UI.GetPickingState() -related matters Added table.lua and math.lua containing the extensions to the respective built-in tables RGBColor creation now clamps the color values Implemented __eq, __add and __sub for RGBColor Various fixes for outdated/clashing IDE class names Fixed an infinite loop when using the default buttons for MessageBox Added a table for combatTurn UI Unfortunately this UI does not appear to hold any character handles, making it not very useful. v1059 - 29/08/22 \u00b6 Fixed an issue with using items in hotbar groups after reloading Fixed item amounts displaying incorrectly in hotbar groups Fixed an issue with the unlearn skills prompt appearing while the UI is closed On the technical side of things: Added \"Actions\" (ground attack, sheathe/unsheathe, etc.) to the Stats library v1058 - 29/08/22 \u00b6 Versions from this one onwards require extender v57. New features: Consumables like food and mushrooms now show their effects by default; there's no need to eat them once for them to appear in the tooltip Added a setting to enable infinite carry weight You can now right-click skills in the skillbook while out of combat to unlearn them Added a keybind to toggle world item tooltips (so you don't need to hold the alt key) Surface tooltips now show their owner (who the surface damage scales from and who owns its applied statuses) Added a setting to disable the \"Item Received\" notifications Added a setting to allow viewing the character sheet while in the quest rewards UI; this lets you compare your equipped items with the rewards. Vanity: transmog and dyes no longer require items to be re-equipped, making it overall faster to try on different looks Added an option to hide empty corpses/containers from the world item tooltips (the ones that appear from the alt key) Added a setting to allow you to walk onto corpses while in combat without looting them. You may still loot them while holding shift. This setting is enabled by default. The fix to character control being lost upon creating new summons now also applies to having your summons be killed Added an option to play a sound effect when a chat message is received, so they're easier to notice Empowering items now properly scales their armor values, but this will only take effect after a reload Fixed the vanilla bug that prevented you from using items in certain conditions if you had +AP Cost effects Added a keybind to scroll the fancy item/skill tooltips ACTIVE_DEFENSE statuses (ex. Empyrean Tears) now show max charges in the tooltip Holding shift while moving in combat now shows approximate decimal AP costs Status tooltips now show if they were applied by an equipped item Fixed the tooltip color for effects that alter AP costs. They now display in green if they reduce AP costs, and red if they increase them. The custom input menu has been reworked to use new extender tech; all keys supported by the game are now bindable, including modifier keys like alt/ctrl. Your previous bindings will be wiped upon updating. Added new modifier keys to cycle bars on the hotbar: ctrl cycles 3rd bar (from bottom), alt cycles 4th one, gui (Windows key) cycles 5th one Added an \"Engrave\" option to the Greatforge which lets you rename items. This is purely visual. It does not currently have a custom graphic. It will appear as another \"Drill Sockets\" in the Greatforge wheel. Minor visual adjustments to QuickExamine The Epip settings menu is slightly more organized now Added more mods to the incompatible mods warning: DU, Greed, Multihotbars Hotbar: Slots can no longer be used while holding modifier keys. This means you can use shift/ctrl/alt + number keys as a custom keybind without it interfering with the hotbar. Fixed loadouts not saving empty gaps inbetween slots You can't cycle hidden bars anymore Added custom slot groups. Right-click a row on the hotbar to create one. These are shared across all your characters. Right-click them to delete them. Known issues: Items there do not display tooltips yet Fixes: Fixed tooltips for Vanity tabs Fixed negative status effects displaying wrong ever since GB5 Epip's artifact tooltips (in Quick Examine, stats tab, etc.) now have a period at the end of them Hotkey to exit Meditate is now escape, instead of escape / right-click. Fixed action names on the hotbar buttons Fixed some character sheet tooltips appearing while in the Vanity menu Stuff for developer mode: Added a keybind to copy identifiers (GUID for chars/items, stat ID for skills) of the object over your mouse Added a settings menu to change Data.txt values ingame. Most of them apply instantly / upon character stat recalculation, but some may require a session reload. Talents show their IDs in tooltips The cheats context menu now lets you add talents Added an option to enable a widget that shows FPS, TPS, and relevant mod versions Added a keybind to open a debug menu from which you can toggle debug mode on features, disable them (or their logging), and run tests (a new feature of the Feature table) On the technical side of things: Osiris library now supports built-in symbols (calls and queries) and extender objects are converted to their GUID when being passed Added a Vector library (with some cool arithmetic operator overloads) Added a new tooltip library (WIP), advantage include preventing tooltips and manipulating surface tooltips, viewing source UI of a tooltip SubscribableEvent nodes can now be removed based on a predicate function, and preventable events are supported Fixed some log spam related to the hotbar Added groundwork for the Epip Housing(TM) feature Slight modernization to Net library: the payload is now passed as the first parameter, and IDE hints are available by defining the net msg as a class with the payload's table fields Timer lib is now available on the server, and a tick-based timer option has been added, as well as option to repeat / pause them Added a better coroutine table with sleeping (either for X seconds, or until a condition is met) Added a new Epip.RegisterFeature() call which can keep track of the source mod of a feature Added a new Input library using v57 RawInput Added more hooks to CharacterSheet UI in preparations for custom talents 2.0 (and other stats) Added ExtraData tables to Stats library Added PartyInventory hooks Removed numerous archaic/unused scripts, like the custom talents ones GenericUI: Added more bg options for TiledBackground Added new elements: Slider, Grid Events now have proper IDE support, and no more issues with inheritance Element creation now has proper IDE support, if you instantiate elements using their class name Added more position-related calls Element visuals now use string IDs, and unused visuals are set off-stage (less possibility for jank) Fixed button size issues Removed minimum size for black background Fixed stack overflow issue with lists Added support for skill tooltips Fixed issues with MouseUp on the slot element Changed mouse events to use the roll ones Added proper support for prefabs, with the following implemented: Spinner Text (offers simpler initialization of Text elements) HotbarSlot (with many improvements to bring it closer to hotbar behavior) FormHorizontalList LabelledCheckbox LabelledDropdown LabelledTextField v1057 - 26/07/22 \u00b6 Fixed the annoying issue of control being switched to new summons in combat while it's still your turn Crafting UI now remembers your last tab (equipment/consumables etc.) Added a setting to set the default tab for the crafting UI The hotbar now shows a warning for unmemorized skills, as well as skills from items that have been unequipped Fixed some changelogs ingame not showing up Added an option to enable some improvements to the save/load menu: alphabetical sorting and search. The search bar supports lua patterns and is case-sensitive On the technical side of things: The hotbar updates periodically again to fix some issues, and should no longer break completely when a single slot/action fails to render v1056 - 22/07/22 \u00b6 Stats Tab: Added Voracity stats Added Artifacts Quick Examine now shows Artifacts for your allies as well (useful in multiplayer) Vanity: added support for \"Visitors from Cyseal\" mod, though the mod currently appears to have some issue with replacing some item icons Fixed a freeze with Immersive Meditation Fixed another grey out issue with the hotbar (skills with weapon damage but no weapon requirement) Fixed the category weight sliders in Epic Enemies not being saved Fixed the \"Show Minimap\" option appearing twice in the options menu Fixed some issues with controllers Skills show their IDs in tooltips in developer mode On the technical side of things: Added StopPropagation() to the new event table Added a wrapper for checking developer mode, with an option to use an additional check; WIP and testing features will be locked behind it, meaning the rest of the features (like the cheats menu) can be used without problems Added a few new utility methods Started work on further giga brain hotbar improvements v1055 - 20/07/22 \u00b6 Added an option to reduce the opacity of the player status bars while in combat Vanity UI now closes when you go into combat Status tooltips now show source (if it's a character) Re-added the hotbar actions drawer (the one with force-attack / sheathe / sneak) Added a Vanity action to the hotbar Added new Combat Log filters: critical hits and dodge Status tooltips now show ID and Type while in developer mode Added embodiments to the stats tab Read books and used keys now show a label in their tooltip (not retroactive) Fixed Max SP check being inaccurate on the enemy health bar Added new divider sprites for the player health bar Player health bar now shows maximum SP, and the SP counters are centered Fix item use cost not being considered while greying out slots on the hotbar Fixed consumable items not greying out properly in the hotbar Fixed hotbar issues with Luminary, Musketeer mods Temorarily removed the option to auto-unlock party inventories due to crashes in v56 from sync rewrites On the technical side of things: Removed more log spam from Hotbar/Input Moved a bunch of tables around, removed archaic scripts/global functions Added some Larian colors to the Color table Added an icons enum to Hotbar More work on the new UI system: event listeners, Slot element Added GetExtType() for checking the type of an extender object Added GameState table Started transitioning to using a better event system, using a modification of the v56 SubscribableEvent table Updated IDE helper files v1054 - 13/07/22 \u00b6 Added a \"Quick Examine\" UI. Currently it only shows the Epic Enemies perks characters that have them. It is invoked by a keybind while hovering over a character; default is v . You may use the lock button to prevent its selected character from changing whenever you hover over a new one; if you do that, you will need to press the keybinding manually to change targets. You can drag the UI around by holding down left click on the upper part (the one with the character name) Artifact powers in Epic Enemies now have descriptions Hotbar now greys out unusable item skills (ex. arrows) Switching characters or clicking slots on the hotbar now attempts to fix desync issues (the one where your clicks go to the wrong rows) Fixed a freeze when using a controller Temporarily removed the Awesome Soccer minigame On the technical side of things: Added a new lua-based UI system; currently supports backgrounds, text, buttons, state buttons, the common list types (vertical, horizontal, scrolling), dividers, and icons v1053 - 07/07/22 \u00b6 Added an option to show aggro effects on the top health bar: taunt source/target as well as AI preference tags Centered the AP orbs on the bottom health bar, and added special dividers every 4 AP Pipmode no longer gives infinite AP to non-player characters Added a cheat to apply statuses Reworded +elemental damage tooltips on weapons Fixed offhand items not auto-transmogging properly Fixed some summons still getting Epic Enemies perks, as well as party followers Fixed skills that require shield not being greyed out while muted Hotbar: Loadouts are now sorted alphabetically Added a setting for disabling slots while casting Fixed occasional flashing for slots on cooldown Fixed hotkeys being blocked if any controlled char is in dialogue On the technical side of things: Added better annotations for UI/Feature tables (works with inheritance now) Added wrapper calls to get/set stats regardless of whether they're actual stat objects or the special types (DeltaMod, TreasureTable, etc.) Moved RemoveTrailingZeros() to Text Reduced some extender log spam from stats Fixed warning spam when enemies were preparing skills v1052 - 05/07/22 \u00b6 Epic Enemies: Reworked the Epic Enemies feature. It is now configured through the regular settings menu, not the EE one. If you're continuing an old save, the options in your EE menu will remain, but they will no longer do anything. The amount of effects enemies gain is now customizable The weighted chance of each perk appearing can be customized individually - it's also possible to adjust the chances for whole groups of effects at once (ex. all Centurion effects) All artifacts can now be made available to enemies Effects with conditional activations are supported, and can grant a variety of other perks (statuses, stats, summons, etc.) though there are no new effects that use this yet - new content will be added soon Hotbar: The \"active skill\" animation on the hotbar should be more reliable now (and no longer appears if you click spells in the spellbook) Fixed shield skills not greying out when disarmed On the technical side of things: Removed the infamous empty net script Cleaned up script loading on the server Generated new IDE helpers for built-in v56 types OptionsSettings UI now has less thicc text labels so you can actually write stuff there without taking up the whole screen Known issues: Artifact effects in Epic Enemies have no descriptions (text keys are really unreliable apparently) Switching tabs in the Epic Enemies settings menu scrolls you to the top Epic Enemies no longer gives extra Predator range v1051 - 28/06/22 \u00b6 Small bug fixes, and a moderate QoL addition for vanity dyes. Added Ctrl+C/V support to the dye tab text fields Fixed Epic Enemies tooltip (thanks Pancarte) Fixed outfits ignoring transmog restrictions Fixed vanity dye slider text values sometimes not moving around Fixed items transmogged into artifacts gaining the special tooltip color (this will require an EE Core update to fully work) On the technical side of things: Cleaned up MessageBox v1050 - 26/06/22 \u00b6 A small assortment of huge vanity improvements! Vanity: Added a button to delete custom dyes Switching characters no longer closes the UI The current tab is remembered when switching items through the context menu Added a toggle to prevent the sliders from being set to the item's current color (makes it easier to reuse a dye on multiple items) Added fields to enter colors in hexadecimal Added buttons to copy/paste colors Added buttons to import/export dyes to/from the clipboard Sliders can now detect the default color of an item that hasn't been dyed before Added a checkbox to auto-transmog equipped items to your old item's appearance while the UI is not open (so you can switch out items in the UI without needing to toggle it off) Fixed the Vanity option appearing on non-equipped items Other: Added keybinds for the debug teleport (no longer uses the ping key) Custom keybinds no longer fire while in dialogue On the technical side of things: Added support for dev-only keybinds Moved Flash table to Client Added a Color table Created a github repository: https://github.com/PinewoodPip/EpipEncounters/commits/main v1049 - 23/06/22 \u00b6 Added an option to enable improvements to the combat log. Messages can be filtered by type, and certain messages will be merged into one line if they occur one after another, such as surface damage and healing. This option will only work when playing in english , unless someone is willing to help me make string patterns for other languages. Right-click the combat log to set your filters. You can also clear the log from that menu. When damage messages are merged into one line, they will display the amount of hits that were merged at the end. The exception to this is damage that occurs within 25ms of eachother, such as weapon attacks with coatings. These are counted as a single hit. Messages parsed by the new combat log system will now have a consistent base color, gray, instead of randomly using white. Some messages have been slightly reworded for consistency Added options in the cheat menu to add/remove tags. You can use this to clear a character's main character status by removing the AVATAR tag. Added a button in the debug sections of the options menu to warp to AMER_Test AMER_Test got Pinewood'd a bit Weapon tooltips now show +elemental damage modifiers Updated Derpy's treasure table displays Removed the option to disable custom context menus Fixed keyword source tooltips being off-by-one Hotbar action button tooltips now show their keybind (without shortening) Removed the automatic unbinding for GM keybinds, since they are no longer used for the hotbar Added chat commands: /rp displays a message over your character's head /emote performs an animation /help lists help for all commands Added a new tab in the controls menu where you can bind hotbar action hotkeys as well as standalone hotkeys for Meditate and Source Infuse. You must rebind your hotbar hotkeys Two keybinds previously used by the hotbar are now reserved as special keys that can be bound in the new custom keybinds UI. The purpose of them is to allow extra mouse buttons and other special bindings to be used with the new system until it is improved. Fixed numerous problems while playing with controllers Added a setting to make the Escape key close the Amer UIs entirely rather than popping page Fixed a hotbar refresh issue when pushing slots around Fixed hotbar action buttons no longer properly showing active/inactive state Removed the option to disable wrapping statuses (it has not actually worked for a long time) as well as the vanity menu Vanity: Added custom RGB dyes to the dyes tab Added all built-in ItemColor entries as selectable dyes Saving now also happens when you add/delete an outfit or a dye You can no longer transmog GB5 items Fixed spears not being available in the transmog menu Fixed the vanity option not appearing for non-shield offhands Added a button to delete outfits Fixed positioning of the vanity UI while playing on resolutions other than 1080p, or when dragging the character sheet Fixed saving outfits with weapons not working Removed the dye context menu for real The UI now shows a message if you select an empty slot, instead of opening a message box Slight changes to positioning of elements Improved performance The character sheet unallocated points notifications are now hidden while in the UI Other: Fixed a bug with hotbar action buttons resetting Added a \"Healing done\" stat to the stats tab The \"Damage dealt\" stat now also considers your owned summons On the technical side of things: Reworked how the selected item is tracked in the Vanity UI Reworked all tabs of Vanity to be separate, independent features Added initial groundwork for supporting controllers in Amer's UIs Added APIs for chatLog , optionsInput _Feature:DebugLog() is now polymorphic like the regular print function Added the Input UI, with possibilities for tracking text keys from the keyboard, and intercepting interface events Added FlexStats for sight and hearing, ranging from -128 to +128 (except for sight which goes to +2048) Added support for saving settings on the server Removed unused ItemColor stats Removed unused PersistentVars table Hooks can now be set to only return the first non-nil value (and stop propagation after that) Cleaned up the client bootstrap script Added an !animtest command on server, auto-playing all female human animations on the host character. There's no stopping it once started, so be careful! Added a !soundtest command on the client, which tests all UI sounds. Might've been added before this version, I don't recall exactly when it was implemented. Added some sick ASCII signatures to the bootstrap scripts, as well as a readme v1048 - 14/05/22 \u00b6 Added a warning upon loading a save with mods known to be problematic Graying out hotbar slots while casting skills should now work similarly to before Added Derpy's scripted encounters to the Treasure Table Display Added an option to disable area transition labels or change their duration. It now also hides immediately if you hover over a character/item to bring up its healthbar Possibly fixed a significant stuttering issue with the hotbar Added a button to revert a transmog'd item's appearance (not retroactive; will only work on newly transmogged items) Changing tabs in the Vanity UI now plays a sound Rounded the numbers in the Treasure Table Display Added a dyes tab to the vanity menu RGB sliders are not finished yet (you can use them in developer mode, but they will not be saved) On the technical side: Fixed a net error message upon loading into the main menu Fixed a startup error related to the Osiris table Added UIObject flag helper methods to the UI table (though Norbyte confirmed these will be usable like other enums in the future) Added ways to set and delete tuples to the Osiris table with :Set() and :Delete(); :Get() queries the DB (previous usage still works). Osiris table's DB queries now return the list of tuples as the last return value, always Added a separate UI for querying time from flash Fixed time functions not accounting for daylight savings (iggy oversight) Added annotations for the _Feature table/class Added a Text library with a handy format function Improvements to events and hooks: libraries can now hold their events and hooks as tables in Event and Hooks fields respectively, from which you can easily see all listener types available and register listeners. Doing it this way enables auto-completion and intellisense/EmmyLua annotations for listener parameters, which was not possible before. Old libraries will slowly be updated to use this, and the old method of registering listeners will stay. The standalone hotbar mod will be updated tomorrow (15th May). v1047 - 20/04/22 \u00b6 Added an option to show artifact/protean chances on enemy health bars when the \"Show Sneak Cones\" (shift by default) key is held. Also works on containers, without needing the key to be held. Fixed an issue with some setup event being unreliable (likely the source of many hotbar problems) Fixed some events being fired once per user Fixed equip animations in the character sheet Client timers are now truly client-side As a result hotkey'd skills on the hotbar should now have a lot less delay Fixed hotbar not being greyed out for dead characters Fixed \"None\"-type weapons not being considered melee, causing incarnate bull rush to appear grayed out in the hotbar Fixed another large performance issue with the stats tab v1046 - 14/04/22 \u00b6 Added a new journal UI, replaces the quest log for changelogs. Access it from the hotbar Fixed Inconspicuous not being hidden in character creation Hotbar config (hotkeys) now also saves when you save the game, not just when the game is paused Incompatible giftbags can no longer be enabled (you should still be able to disable them, if you had them) Added a way to mark templates as favorites in the vanity UI, moving them to a special category Vanity UI now shows categories in a consistent order Small change to stats tab to make stats editable post-SessionLoaded Character sheet now goes below the hotbar again Increased the hotbar's \"refresh rate\", fixing an issue with slots being clickable when they shouldn't Fixed the hotbar drawer locking up your scroll wheel Renamed the transmog context menu option to \"Vanity\", made it only usable on equipped items Added support for Rendal's NPC Armors to the vanity UI Reduced logging when developer mode is off You can no longer open the vanity menu while in combat Your currently equipped template in the vanity menu is now indicated by an icon instead of a suffix Fixed Immersive Meditation ignoring the setting Fixed a performance issue with the stats tab v1045 - 1/4/22 Anniversary patch :flashed: \u00b6 As of today, Epip is now one year old! My attention span for projects tends to be very low (as evidenced by my other EE stuff), but Epip looks to be an exception to that and it's incredible what it has become - all its UI changes were nearly unimaginable just a year ago. Thank you all for the support throughout the months, even at times when the patches were a buggy mess. Just like the initial release of the mod on April 1st, this anniversary patch is very real, and best experienced on this day of the month. Changelog: Pressing escape while in the EE UIs now backs out of them rather than bring up the pause menu The stats tab now shows damage dealt and received in the current fight (or previous fight, when out of combat) Added a new bug to the character sheet Performance improvements to the hotbar Gold/Splinter counter in the stats tab should now be more reliable Minor technical changes to make the mod compatible with Descent Added a scrollbar to the hotbar buttons drawer The hotbar now goes below the inventory and character sheet Hotbar cooldown animations should now be smoother Fixed bugs with unbinding actions in the hotbar, as well as clearing unmemorized slots Fixed muted characters not having their slots greyed out in hotbar You can now activate your Epip Encounters license ingame from the options menu Tooltips can now be scrolled on one axis with the mouse wheel The punisher now drops MicroBoss\u2122 loot to make him feel more optional Added a cinematic camera option, on by default Reworked the vanity feature: it now opens a custom tab in your character sheet. Browsing templates is a lot more convenient this way. Saved outfits are now categorized by race & gender (doesn't stop you from applying them to anyone though) It wouldn't be an Epip patch if something didn't ship unfinished, which is why I must announce that the promised feature to mark templates as favorite did not make it in. On the technical side of things: Added an alias for the Ext table to make it easier to type: SEX = Ext -- Short for \"Script EXtender\" SEX.Print(\"Welcome to Norbyte's SEX v56 !\") Fixed more inconsistencies with copy/paste in the message boxes Added an option to log AI scoring to the console: the top 3 actions will be shown anytime decisions are made. Work-in-progress as some of the AI features in the extender are currently bugged. Tooltips for Ascension stats in the stats tab are now created dynamically, so there's no need to edit them if you've edited the description/name Added a Server table on the client, from which listeners for any Osiris symbol can be created, eliminating the need for boilerplate code on the server side if you need to listen for Osiris stuff. Added an Osiris table on server to make user queries and DB queries a bit less aids to use in lua: -- DBs with only one tuple return their contents directly, rather than as a list local _, value = Osiris.DB_PIP_EpicStats_DamageDealt(char.MyGuid, nil) -- User queries can also return variables directly from their output DBs, even for queries with multiple outputs local value = Osiris.QRY_AMER_KeywordStat_VitalityVoid_GetRadius(char.MyGuid, 1) On the future side of things: Development has slowed down throughout March due to work and studies, but I'm not planning on stopping work on Epip anytime soon, and there are lots of exciting features in the planning stages. There is no time estimate for any of them, they're just things I know I will try out eventually . I know creating expectations never ends up well, but for the anniversary I felt it would be nice to write down the ideas I'm planning for the near future: Character sheet overhaul: the attribute/ability/talent tabs will become easily moddable, for modifying or adding new entries to them. This will pave the way for custom attributes and abilities. The UI currently used for the custom vanity tab will be made generic, so anyone can add their own tabs. Proper controller support for EE UIs: a large undertaking, but something that looks to be very possible and would be a massive quality of life improvement. Custom journal UI: will replace the current changelog functionality. The plan is to use the GM mode's journal UI as a base, since it's a slick, full-screen UI with support for nested categories. The functionality will be made generic, you'd be able to use it for more than just changelogs. A way to create UIs just from lua: work on this already started back in early January; it's used for the [REDACTED] in Fort Joy, but it's quite incomplete. The plan is to allow for creation of UIs with backgrounds, text, and all the Larian form elements (buttons, dropdowns, sliders etc.), all without touching any swf. More documentation for the source code, namely the remaining UI scripts and the base metatables Thanks for reading and I hope you have an epic 1st of April. 19/2/22 Huge Hotbar rewrite \u00b6 Rewrote the hotbar UI. This involves mostly technical changes, in preparations for a standalone release. Your hotkey keybindings will be reset with this update! Please bind them again. Visible changes: Fixed the top of the buttons area blocking clicks onto the world and other UIs Any skill or item can now be dragged from the hotbar to the customizable buttons to bind it there (useful for old mods that use skills/items to bring up menus) The \"use last slot\" action has been removed due to this. Removed the \"view changelog\" action The slot rendering is now entirely scripted (no help from the engine) which works around a crash and removes the need for an initialization procedure (that annoying \"switch to the first row\" message) Saving your current amount of bars and order should be a lot more reliable (now happens upon pausing the game, instead of a timer) Action buttons can now be highlighted or disabled; ex. the pyramids one is disabled if the party has no pyramids Added an action to open the pyramids UI Fixed the source skill border clipping into other rows Added compatibility for Weapon Expansion: adds an action for toggling the menu, and repositions the original button when you have 2 rows of action buttons Actions in the drawer are now ordered in a consistent manner Added a context menu when you right click a row; from there, you can: \"Push\" groups of slots to the left/right (useful for inserting skills inbetween slots) Clear rows, or unmemorized skills Save and load \"loadouts\" of rows. Loadouts can be applied even if your character doesn't currently know all the skills from it. Other changes: Simple tooltips (the ones that go in that very small black box) now appear much faster, rather than being delayed Added numerous calls to Game.Character and Game.Item , mostly related to functionality needed for the hotbar. 5/2/22 Docs inauguration patch :flashed: \u00b6 Added new stats to the stats tab (more coming later): Party gold, splinters Celestial restoration Vitality Void damage, radius Prosperity threshold Rewrote the ingame options menu; the mod's settings now gets its own tab instead of being stuffed into Gameplay You can now switch to and from Tactician difficulty at any time from settings Improved context menu scrolling Touchups to MessageBox, Examine Cleaned up Utilities.lua, removed old unused methods Removed support for the archaic config file structure (from before the ingame settings menu; very old) Created documentation for Game , OptionsSettings, MessageBox, StatsTab, Examine, and CharacterSheet 26/1/22: birthday patch :flashed: \u00b6 Fixed \u201cTeleport to\u201d not working on anything other than characters; it now works with items and triggers as well Fixed shields not showing all transmog options Fixed more inconsistency issues with context menus on world characters Transmog menu now works properly for characters that have had their race/gender changed Added an option to show B/H next to player portraits while unsheathed Fixed tooltips of damaging statuses for real Added an option to force story patching on every load Physical/pierce resistances in character sheet now get colored blue/red like how the normal resistances would Holding shift now fades out statuses on the enemy health bar Temporary solution for scrolling context menus that would leave the screen, with the mouse wheel Added something awesome to Fort Joy Technical stuff so it doesn\u2019t look like I\u2019m doing nothing: \u00b6 Added utility methods for initializing \u201cFeatures\u201d You can now specify required filesystem overrides and mods for features, with them automatically disabling themselves if these are missing Removed GetCharacterDodge function Rewrote character sheet resistances script Rewrote script for enemy health bar Moved Majora\u2019s compatibility to its own script Added Game.Character library for character-related stuff Moved a lot of old calls to Client Started work on a library that allows the creation of UIs purely in lua (no swf/actionscript editing) 14/1/22: \u00b6 Re-enabled custom icons on the UIs that previously used them, as the extender issues with them have been fixed. Added a transmog context menu, can be enabled in settings. Appears on equipment with visuals, including weapons. Submenus display categorized root templates, filtered down to only the ones compatible with your current race/gender/alive/undead. Supports Majora\u2019s Fashion Sins. Can save/load outfits, along with their dyes. Saved outfits are in EPIP_VanityOutfits.json Warning: artifacts and armor set items will not currently work properly when transmogrified. Also, Majora\u2019s tabs tend to overflow the screen. Fixed status tooltips in v56 Fixed extract runes context menu option consuming gold instead of splinters Numerous miscellaneous internal changes 27/12/21: \u00b6 Updated to v56 of the extender. Current issues (with the extender): Anything related to status tooltip editing does not work as Game.Tooltip is borked UIs with custom icons (hotbar, toolip) stop displaying vanilla icons after the first session. Custom icons are disabled for now so as to keep both the hotbar and console usable Removed the old console cheats Full rewrite of the stats tab; it should be a lot more reliable now (especially in multiplayer) and survives lua resets Stats and categories are now defined in Epip.Features.StatsTab. Fixed context menu not working on chained characters, and added it to summon portraits (maybe) fixed summon portrait display issues Custom talents now display in the examine menu Organizational changes to tooltip adjustments script torturerSkillOverrides was moved to Data.Game.TORTURER_SKILL_OVERRIDES statusToSkill was moved to Data.Game.DAMAGING_STATUS_SKILLS v1043 (19/12/21) \u00b6 Added critical chance to the examine menu, below damage Added an option to set the default position of the Examine menu (middle, left, or right of the screen) Fixed health bar appearing in character creation Added a new context menu option to dismantle all equipment within a container. Only shows up when there's equipment within a container. Dismantling through the context menu now requires shift-clicking for any equipped item Fixed right-clicking containers bringing up debugging cheats for the character you previously had selected Organizational changes to various UI scripts and older features, as preparations for the grand debut of the Epip modding docs Reuploaded on 22/12/21 with the following fixes: More organizational changes (moving Data.UI to Client.UI.Data) Fixed immunities in examine showing up in the wrong place Undid some recent changes that lead to playerInfo summon display breaking Reuploaded on 23/12/21 to remove some testing text in character creation, as well as to (maybe?) fix an issue with combat HUD disappearing in new games. v1042 (14/12/21) \u00b6 Added an option to hide hotbar hotkeys text Added an \"Immersive Meditation\" setting which disables hotbar and minimap UIs while in Amer UIs Added shortened names for the remaining numpad keys (multiply, add, minus, etc.) Added an auto-identify setting, with 2 modes: always, and only with enough Loremaster. This will instantly identify items when they are generated Item tooltips no longer overflow through the top of the screen, making it easier to see the damage stats on items with 3 filled sockets Dismantling from the context menu now requires shift-clicking for items with runes inside (as a way to mark them as 'important' and avoid misclicks related to a certain new feature) Added a context menu option to items to dye them (requires the dyes to be in the party's inventory) Added a context menu to player portraits to hide statuses and summons (not saved between reloads for now) Added a context menu option to extract runes from items Added a debug menu with cheats for characters, available in the extender's developer mode Accessed by right-clicking a character in the world, or a player portrait in the left portraits UI Allows you to add all sorts of stats, spells, SpecialLogic, spawn items, treasure tables, toggle godmode, and more The new context menu tech is quite extensive, and can be toggled off in the settings in case any serious issues arise Finesse recovery now works for pay X skills, and sucker punch You can add more exceptions to DB_PIP_WeaponBasedFinesse_Whitelist((STRING)_Skill) Fixed overhead dialogue durations being wrong when they were changed away from the default value Overhead sizes are now always default in Amer UIs Fixed origins gaining epic enemies perks for real this time Fixed description of Clouded Memory Fixed map visibility setting not working after exiting respec Fixed being able to toggle minimap within character creation Fixed weapon range deltamod tooltip showing up on unidentified items Fixed wrong health bar B/H display on dead characters The dismantle context menu option should no longer get permanently stuck in case of unidentified shenanigans Added a 20% tax to dismantling items from context menus, used to amortize the development costs of the new menus as well as to fund future development of the mod just kidding v1041 (23/10/21) \u00b6 Added a slider for status overhead duration Fixed damage overheads for items not working with the new size settings Fixed the talents tab being selected after exiting mirror Fixed character sheet not updating the first time it is opened after a respec Fixed decimal stat adjustments being lost while merging them into one tooltip Fixed character creation talent points display when changing presets Fixed 1st hotbar not being clickable after a lua reset Fixed hotbar cooldown/active overlays when joining mid-session This should also have fixed the issue with loading a save during a summon turn Origins should no longer get Epic Enemies buffs Possibly fixed unidentified items showing the weapon range deltamods in the tooltip v1040 (19/10/21) \u00b6 Added some client APIs for the message box UI and overhead texts (Client.UI.MessageBox and Client.UI.Overheads) Added settings for overhead sizes Added a setting to bring back the vanilla combat log button (on by default) Fixed talents not being hidden properly in the character creation UI (which includes the mirror, it's the same UI) Fixed EE stats tab not working for new companions until a reload Fixed sliders in the options menu being saved with +1 step than what you've set them to v1039 (17/10/21) \u00b6 Fixed SI tooltip highlighting not working for a few schools Fixed wrong earth damage color in shift-tooltips v1038 (16/10/21) \u00b6 Added a hotbar hotkey to use the skill/item on the very last slot of your hotbar (right-most in 5th row) Can use this to make a Source Vamp hotkey, for example Weapon range deltamods now show up like regular deltamods on the tooltip, and the weapon range display is split up to show both base and extra range Holding the show cones button (shift by default) will display skill damage as their multipliers When infusing or when the shift key is held, unmet SI requirements will be displayed in red text Possibly fixed the \"auto-unlock inventories\" feature Artifact items now show quality Added an option to log all UI ExternalInterface calls and invokes to the console, visible in the settings menu if the extender developer mode is enabled Started slowly organizing code into sensical libraries; anything in the extended Game table should be reliable and will likely not change names Let me know if something that used to work before broke all of a sudden Fixed an error in the console when hovering over armor whose subtype could not be determined (ex. the starting tattered equipment) Character Creation UI now implements machine learning and blockchain technology to notify you of possible typos in your character names Added a WIP custom talents feature. See EpipTalents.lua for usage example. You can also hide any non-racial talent. Shortcomings: They will only display on kb+m. No controller UI support yet. They do not show up in the examine UI yet. Requirements are not rechecked while moving ability/attribute points around in the mirror; upon exiting, you will still lose any talents you cannot sustain Can't bind them to deltamods Rarely, the mirror UI might show you having fewer talent points than you do - this should fix itself if you exit the mirror and go back in (if someone has a save where this happens consistently, let me know) As a result of the talent UI changes, the bug with unequipping walk-it-off should be fixed v1037 (2/10/21) \u00b6 Fixed right-most zeros getting culled in stat adjustment tooltips Added a new setting to disable fog of war (server-wide, host-only, non-destructive; can be reverted) Minor visual bug: re-enabling FoW will cause the world to go black until you unpause v1036 (1/10/21) \u00b6 Changed the Damage tooltip in character sheet to be less confusing Removed the obsolete \"From LW: -0%\" tooltip text from character sheet Removed the word \"Set:\" from deltamods Added an option to auto-unlock inventories in multiplayer upon loading a save. This setting is per player. Fixed negative stat adjustments not being grouped together in tooltips Equipment now shows a \"Quality\" rating in tooltips, which denotes how good its damage/armor roll was. An item with 100% Quality has the best roll (only possible for Divines) Trickster's Repertoire now grants invisibility+sneaking until the start of your first turn, and only causes you to sneak starting from your second round. Additionally, at the start of your turns, you always unsneak. Changed wording for the Hothead tooltip Fixed error spam in console upon reload, and reorganized some code Added a lifesteal stat to the stats tab (will update upon changing Necromancy points, or in combat) Finished support for preset descriptions in character creation, override CharacterCreation.characterCreationPresetDescriptions in CharacterCreationUI.lua to set them v1035 (12/09/21) \u00b6 Replaced the config json file with an ingame settings menu, available from the game's normal \"Gameplay settings\" tab Unidentified artifacts now show their rarity as artifact, and use the custom color Proteans and Artifact runes now also use the Artifact color, and slots that they cannot be put on have a warning message Fixed Trickster's Repertoire breaking sneaking from other effects that cause you to sneak Fixed hotbar initialization message (again) v1032 (05/09/21) \u00b6 Small patch with some QoL for dyes and a fix for a Finesse issue. Dyeing equipped items will now re-quip them automatically Changed the finesse recovery for weapon-based skills to fix an issue with delayed procs if multiple things used its logic Removed the option to show enemy lvl in healthbar (still buggy!) v1030 (30/08/21) \u00b6 Monthly patch to appease our ever-so-hungry Derpy overlord. Hotbar slot keys now work as expected - ex. pressing \"4\" will use the fourth skill on the bottom bar, regardless of the row it's set to Hotbar actions now show their keybinding, if they have one Vanilla actions (ex. open journal) will always show the vanilla keybind instead of the custom one (it will still work, though) Re-enabled the keyboard hotkeys for hotbar actions by default. If you had these disabled previously (or if you're using the mod for the first time), its keys will be unbound upon loading in Changed the default hotbar bindings to swap ping with combat log Added a hotbar action for Portable Respec Mirror, if its mod is loaded Resting from the hotbar now uses the item rather than resting directly (should work with other bedroll mods now) Added a toggle for the minimap onto the hotbar You can no longer rearrange hotbar actions while the hotbar is locked (except within the skills panel) Added a faint blinking animation to the health bar when B/H have 1 turn or less remaining Added an option to show level next to character name in the top healthbar (on by default) You can now unbind hotbar action buttons with middle-click Added handling for when hotbar actions are removed from a save (ex. disabling a mod that adds them) Brittle status now shows its calculated damage like DoTs Masterworked items now show a warning in the tooltip Changed Splintered Arrow icon Fixed Escapist being a huntsman skill Fix protruding hotbar texture on the bottom bar Fixed Trickster's Repertoire removing AP in consecutive turns Trickster's Repertoire no longer activates while playing dead Fixed artifact names not using the new color (oops) Moved the casting notification slightly up so multiline ones don't overlap the health bar Fixed dragging items onto the world not working if the hotbar was enabled Fixed the add/remove rows button being available on summons after opening the pause menu You can no longer use hotbar action hotkeys in dialogues (or other occasions where the UI is entirely hidden), when there is a UI element focused, or when the game is paused Fixed name of hotbar slot 6 binding in the input menu Fixed Slowed 3 AP penalty stacking v1029 (06/08/21) \u00b6 Moved the casting notifications to where your health bar is, and added a toggle for them in the settings (defaults to enabled) Toggle party link hotbar hotkey is now instant (no casting animation) Added a one-row layout to the hotbar actions bar, which is automatically used when you only have one row of skill slots active You can control the behaviour with the new hotbarHotkeysLayout setting: \"auto\" is the behaviour described above, \"single\" makes it always use the 1-row layout, \"dual\" forces it to always be two rows (like how it was before) Keyboard hotkeys remain functional at all times, even if the buttons are hidden Fixed \"c\" displaying on the hotbar button you're dragging DoT statuses now show their calculated damage The display fluctuates for a bit after a skill cast, might redo this entirely later to not rely on the engine damage formula Centurion Battlestomp can now only be cast if the target is at <10m, and does not consume the ranged charge Tried banishing the \"Enemy Turn\" message again v1027, v1028 (30/07/21 and 31/07/21) \u00b6 This patch contains numerous fixes and the first part of the rework of hotbar hotkeys. Happy birthday Derpy! Replaced the tutorials tab in the journal with a patch notes tab See EpipPatchNotes.lua for an example on how to use this in your own mod. Artifact tooltips now show \"Artifact\" as rarity rather than Unique Hotbar Updates Added customizable hotbar action hotkeys/buttons. Drag and drop to rearrange/assign them, right click to bring up a list of all actions. Mods can add their own actions very easily; see HotbarActions.lua for an example. To use them with keyboard keys, assign the \"Hotbar Hotkey #\" keys from the game's controls menu. Rebinding them will be easier in the future. You must also enable them within the config file. This rework is a work-in-progress, both in terms of functionality and art; in the future there will also be a 1-row layout. The multihotbar is now enabled by default. Set \"disableHotbar\" to true in the config file to disable it. (the old setting now does nothing) Deprecated the Infusion and Meditate hotkeys; please use the hotbar version of them from now on. Summons can no longer add hotbar rows All the custom elements should now hide during dialogues Fixed jankiness when using low resolutions Fixes Fixed player status bar sometimes clipping through portraits and appearing to the left of them Fixed stat adjustments tooltip not working properly on resists Fixed stat adjustments tooltip eating up all other boosts Fixed boss frame in the enemy health bar UI. It should work consistently now Leper rune now should properly grant the talent when it's socketed into an equipped item Fixed being able to infuse out-of-turn with the hotkey (rest in peace gigabrain infused reaction builds) Possibly disabled turn notifications on the hotbar health bar Known issues \"Actions\" drawer (attack/sneak/sheathe) does not work well along with the default keyboard hotkey, and the menu is not repositioned Buttons on the hotbar don't yet light up like they do in vanilla Order of actions in drawer is random Some hotbar buttons do not have state animations yet The title in the patch notes menu will not be the right color the first time after a reload Earlier changelogs are available on the old google doc.

Standalone usage warning If you have the Improved Hotbar mod, you must disable it to use Epip . All of its functions are already in Epip (+ like 9 months worth of updates that the workshop mod never got). See the front page and the changelog if you're new to Epip. Download here . With this version, EE has been removed as a dependency. It's now possible to use Epip in a non-EE playthrough and the main features will work. There may be quirks that need ironing out, ex. references to features or settings that only make sense in EE - please report these. This also means that the remaining gameplay changes have been removed. If you wish to keep them, use this mod . The following patchnotes are the merged patchnotes of all beta versions of the patch, excluding the April Fools one. By the way, due to logistics changes, you will have to re-enable immersive meditation in the settings, if you had it on. Animation cancelling now has 2 modes: client-side (v1065 behaviour) and server-side (old behaviour). The server-side option uses the lower delay that was used previously. Changed how hotbar row count and visibility is saved This might not work in multiplayer due to extender shenanigans Custom status UI elements are now bigger (ex. in Quick Examine) Added a new rune crafting system; simply right-click a rune material and select the new option in the dropdown menu to get started. Reworked the stats tab; should be less prone to bugging out in multiplayer now Also fixed the gold & splinter stat The incompatible mods warnings now show on every load, rather than once per playthrough Updated localizations and added Brazilian Portuguese, translated by Ferocidade Character sheet skew during anniversaries is now less extreme Removed the \"cinematic combat\" option Fixes: Fixed some log spam related to status icons Fixed hotbar loadouts not working Non-english languages should no longer have broken artifact descriptions The cause was fetching the TSKs during module load, which causes a bug that overwrites the string. Fixed Quick Examine not being openable for the same character twice in a row Fixed vanity dyes not applying to slots that vanilla armor (without transmog) would hide/mask Fixed error if an item was transmogged into a template that no longer existed Fixed a typo in the settings to fix Astrologer's Gaze tooltip On the technical side of things: Added ActionReleased event to Input library Added GetIcon() to BatteredHarried library Added GetLevelID() to Entity library Largely decoupled the logic for custom keybinds away from the UI itself (onto InputLib) Added EpicEncounters.DeltaMods library with dynamically-generated data about EE deltamods Added DragDropStateChanged event to Pointer lib Equipped artifacts are now tracked using UserVars instead of tags Generic: Added RepositionElements() to Grid Added Destroy() to UI instances Fixes and additions to PlayerInfo methods Moved various functionality from Feature up to its parent class Library (UserVars, ModVars) Fixed some warning spam related to status icons Various new checks to disable EE features when playing vanilla Fixed setting ID conflict issues in the settings menu Various fixes to debug cheats Reworked the doc generation script again; the doc appearance has changed considerably, and now supports hotlinking to functions Added support for multiple inheritance to classes made with the OOP library Generic UIs can be fetched by string ID now (oops) Added Character.Events.ItemEquipped Updated the Generic example script and documentation Net payloads now have methods to fetch the associated character and/or item Added Osiris.GetFirstFact() Added new calls to CharacterLib: IsOrigin() , IsPlayer() Small changes to annotations and rewrites of code that was using deprecated stuff Began work on a new cheats system and UI Added Client.IsCursorOverUI() and Client.GetActiveUI() Added Input.IsTextFieldFocused() Added skillstate-related methods to CharacterLib Reworked hotbar prepared/casting skill checks to not require server information Added Client.Events.SkillStateChanged","title":"v1065 - 07/05/23"},{"location":"patchnotes/#v1064-050323","text":"Download here . Requires extender v58+. Quick Examine improvements: Added display for AP, SP, and initiative Added resistances display Added numerous settings: opacity, width/height, hiding certain widgets. You can find them in a new tab in the settings menu Minor graphical touch-ups Added a setting to set the default position of the UI; this position will be used after reloading Added a statuses bar (toggleable) Added a light stroke to the resistances text Added a B/H display, with buffered damage towards the next stack Now shows your ally's skills and their cooldowns Tooltips will show the damage as if they were used by them, but Epip features (like viewing which source infusions are available) likely do not work properly currently Reworked the settings menu and underlying system Your previous setting values will be lost The settings menu is now separate from the vanilla UI, prevent conflicts with mods that may overwrite the vanilla one Settings have been reorganized into separate tabs Settings are now saved per-profile, in Osiris Data/Epip/{profile GUID}/ In the settings menu, the current tab's button is now highlighted (replicating vanilla behaviour) Reworked the settings menu to be more easily expandable and changed the appearance of settings Tabs with a large amount of options (ex. Epic Enemies) might suffer stutters while opening them, similar to Quick Find. This is an issue with the UI framework that will be investigated later. Added a new UI that shows a filtered view of the party inventory Opened with Ctrl+F by default (configurable in input menu) Can filter equipment by slot, consumables by scrolls/grenades/potions, and skillbooks by school Weapons and armor can be filtered by type (ex. sword, leather armor...) Equipment can be searched by their stat boosts (supports only vanilla modifiers for now) Right-click an equipped item to open the UI with filters set to that item's slot, to quickly replace gear Vanity internals have been reworked, with multiple changes as a result: Dyes no longer require deltamods and thus should no longer be lost to shenanigans or bloat the savefile Transmogrifying no longer requires the item to be transformed and therefore should no longer have any gameplay side effects As a result, you are no longer prevented from transmogrifying GB5 sets Transmogrifying weapons into another type (ex. dagger -> bow) will have them show in the proper location while sheathed Added an option to keep the icon while transmogrifying Fixed an issue with dyes not being loaded properly from oufits Added an option to hide any armor slot's visuals Due to an engine quirk, changing visibility is not properly reflected in the character sheet until you switch characters Removed support for vanity dyes from before v1063; items still using them will appear purple Added an \"Auras\" tab to Vanity, where you can apply visual effects to your character, onto various bones Added an option for animation-cancelling for player characters A new setting exists to blacklist skills from being affected. A more user-friendly way of adding entries will be added in a future version Added a setting that controls how character level is displayed in the health bar; defaults to current behaviour (below bar, when holding shift). Includes the option to hide the level entirely. Reworked the \"show minimap\" setting; should be more reliable now You can now drag + drop items onto the Greatforge socket \"Status effects\" in the vanilla examine UI is now capitalized, for consistency with the rest of the headers Began removing gameplay changes from original versions of Epip. Since the focus of the mod has changed over to UI and QoL, gameplay changes no longer make sense within the project, and impede it from being used without EE.

My attention span for projects tends to be very low (as evidenced by my other EE stuff), but Epip looks to be an exception to that and it's incredible what it has become - all its UI changes were nearly unimaginable just a year ago. Thank you all for the support throughout the months, even at times when the patches were a buggy mess. Just like the initial release of the mod on April 1st, this anniversary patch is very real, and best experienced on this day of the month. Changelog: Pressing escape while in the EE UIs now backs out of them rather than bring up the pause menu The stats tab now shows damage dealt and received in the current fight (or previous fight, when out of combat) Added a new bug to the character sheet Performance improvements to the hotbar Gold/Splinter counter in the stats tab should now be more reliable Minor technical changes to make the mod compatible with Descent Added a scrollbar to the hotbar buttons drawer The hotbar now goes below the inventory and character sheet Hotbar cooldown animations should now be smoother Fixed bugs with unbinding actions in the hotbar, as well as clearing unmemorized slots Fixed muted characters not having their slots greyed out in hotbar You can now activate your Epip Encounters license ingame from the options menu Tooltips can now be scrolled on one axis with the mouse wheel The punisher now drops MicroBoss\u2122 loot to make him feel more optional Added a cinematic camera option, on by default Reworked the vanity feature: it now opens a custom tab in your character sheet. Browsing templates is a lot more convenient this way. Saved outfits are now categorized by race & gender (doesn't stop you from applying them to anyone though) It wouldn't be an Epip patch if something didn't ship unfinished, which is why I must announce that the promised feature to mark templates as favorite did not make it in. On the technical side of things: Added an alias for the Ext table to make it easier to type: SEX = Ext -- Short for \"Script EXtender\" SEX.Print(\"Welcome to Norbyte's SEX v56 !\") Fixed more inconsistencies with copy/paste in the message boxes Added an option to log AI scoring to the console: the top 3 actions will be shown anytime decisions are made. Work-in-progress as some of the AI features in the extender are currently bugged. Tooltips for Ascension stats in the stats tab are now created dynamically, so there's no need to edit them if you've edited the description/name Added a Server table on the client, from which listeners for any Osiris symbol can be created, eliminating the need for boilerplate code on the server side if you need to listen for Osiris stuff. Added an Osiris table on server to make user queries and DB queries a bit less aids to use in lua: -- DBs with only one tuple return their contents directly, rather than as a list local _, value = Osiris.DB_PIP_EpicStats_DamageDealt(char.MyGuid, nil) -- User queries can also return variables directly from their output DBs, even for queries with multiple outputs local value = Osiris.QRY_AMER_KeywordStat_VitalityVoid_GetRadius(char.MyGuid, 1) On the future side of things: Development has slowed down throughout March due to work and studies, but I'm not planning on stopping work on Epip anytime soon, and there are lots of exciting features in the planning stages. There is no time estimate for any of them, they're just things I know I will try out eventually . I know creating expectations never ends up well, but for the anniversary I felt it would be nice to write down the ideas I'm planning for the near future: Character sheet overhaul: the attribute/ability/talent tabs will become easily moddable, for modifying or adding new entries to them. This will pave the way for custom attributes and abilities. The UI currently used for the custom vanity tab will be made generic, so anyone can add their own tabs. Proper controller support for EE UIs: a large undertaking, but something that looks to be very possible and would be a massive quality of life improvement. Custom journal UI: will replace the current changelog functionality. The plan is to use the GM mode's journal UI as a base, since it's a slick, full-screen UI with support for nested categories. The functionality will be made generic, you'd be able to use it for more than just changelogs. A way to create UIs just from lua: work on this already started back in early January; it's used for the [REDACTED] in Fort Joy, but it's quite incomplete. The plan is to allow for creation of UIs with backgrounds, text, and all the Larian form elements (buttons, dropdowns, sliders etc.), all without touching any swf. More documentation for the source code, namely the remaining UI scripts and the base metatables Thanks for reading and I hope you have an epic 1st of April.","title":"v1045 - 1/4/22 Anniversary patch :flashed:"},{"location":"patchnotes/#19222-huge-hotbar-rewrite","text":"Rewrote the hotbar UI. This involves mostly technical changes, in preparations for a standalone release. Your hotkey keybindings will be reset with this update! Please bind them again. Visible changes: Fixed the top of the buttons area blocking clicks onto the world and other UIs Any skill or item can now be dragged from the hotbar to the customizable buttons to bind it there (useful for old mods that use skills/items to bring up menus) The \"use last slot\" action has been removed due to this. Removed the \"view changelog\" action The slot rendering is now entirely scripted (no help from the engine) which works around a crash and removes the need for an initialization procedure (that annoying \"switch to the first row\" message) Saving your current amount of bars and order should be a lot more reliable (now happens upon pausing the game, instead of a timer) Action buttons can now be highlighted or disabled; ex. the pyramids one is disabled if the party has no pyramids Added an action to open the pyramids UI Fixed the source skill border clipping into other rows Added compatibility for Weapon Expansion: adds an action for toggling the menu, and repositions the original button when you have 2 rows of action buttons Actions in the drawer are now ordered in a consistent manner Added a context menu when you right click a row; from there, you can: \"Push\" groups of slots to the left/right (useful for inserting skills inbetween slots) Clear rows, or unmemorized skills Save and load \"loadouts\" of rows. Loadouts can be applied even if your character doesn't currently know all the skills from it.

Extended to allow for custom setting tabs. Note that the input menu is a different UI - documentation for it pending. Adding settings \u00b6 To create a tab with settings for your mod, start by calling RegisterMod(mod: string, data: OptionsSettingsOptionSet) , before SessionLoading - preferably in the lua script's body. The data table should have your mod's name, header (displayed at the top) and side button label (displayed on the button that switches tabs). You may also pass Options in the table at this time, or register settings later through RegisterOptions . Client.UI.OptionsSettings.RegisterMod(\"EpipEncounters\", { SideButtonLabel = \"Epip Encounters\", TabHeader = \"<font color='7e72d6' size='23'>Epip Encounters</font>\", }) Options is a list of the options for the settings tab, in order that they will appear in. They are in the OptionsSettingsOption format - see fields . The following types of options exist: Checkbox : OptionsSettingsCheckbox struct Dropdown : OptionsSettingsDropdown struct Slider : OptionsSettingsSlider struct Button : OptionsSettingsButton struct Header : OptionsSettingsHeader struct, just a text label. Good for dividing sections of your setting menu. Example options, a dropdown and a slider: { ID = \"ExaminePosition\", Type = \"Dropdown\", Label = \"Examine Menu Position\", Tooltip = \"Controls the default position of the Examine menu when it is opened.\", DefaultValue = 1, Options = { \"Center\", \"Middle Right\", \"Middle Left\" } }, { ID = \"OverheadsSize\", Type = \"Slider\", Label = \"Overhead Text Size\", MinAmount = 10, MaxAmount = 45, DefaultValue = 19, Interval = 1, HideNumbers = false, Tooltip = \"Controls the size of regular text above characters talking.<br><br>Default is 19.\", }, Once you've got your mod and settings registered, they will appear in the settings menu. The user will be able to change them, and their values will be stored to the disk. To query the value of a setting, use GetOptionValue(mod: string, setting: string) . For checkboxes this returns boolean , for other elements it's number . Dropdowns use 1-based indexing! (1 = first option) . You can also set the stored value (or hook GetOptionValue ). If you do this, keep in mind that it will not be automatically saved to disk. if (Minimap.visible ~= Client.UI.OptionsSettings.GetOptionValue(\"EpipEncounters\", \"Minimap\")) then Client.UI.OptionsSettings.SetOptionValue(\"EpipEncounters\", \"Minimap\", Minimap.visible) Client.UI.OptionsSettings.SaveSettings() end You may use the IsElementEnabled hook to make elements in your menu non-interactable.

The data table should have your mod's name, header (displayed at the top) and side button label (displayed on the button that switches tabs). You may also pass Options in the table at this time, or register settings later through RegisterOptions . Client.UI.OptionsSettings.RegisterMod(\"EpipEncounters\", { SideButtonLabel = \"Epip Encounters\", TabHeader = \"<font color='7e72d6' size='23'>Epip Encounters</font>\", }) Options is a list of the options for the settings tab, in order that they will appear in. They are in the OptionsSettingsOption format - see fields . The following types of options exist: Checkbox : OptionsSettingsCheckbox struct Dropdown : OptionsSettingsDropdown struct Slider : OptionsSettingsSlider struct Button : OptionsSettingsButton struct Header : OptionsSettingsHeader struct, just a text label. Good for dividing sections of your setting menu. Example options, a dropdown and a slider: { ID = \"ExaminePosition\", Type = \"Dropdown\", Label = \"Examine Menu Position\", Tooltip = \"Controls the default position of the Examine menu when it is opened.\", DefaultValue = 1, Options = { \"Center\", \"Middle Right\", \"Middle Left\" } }, { ID = \"OverheadsSize\", Type = \"Slider\", Label = \"Overhead Text Size\", MinAmount = 10, MaxAmount = 45, DefaultValue = 19, Interval = 1, HideNumbers = false, Tooltip = \"Controls the size of regular text above characters talking.<br><br>Default is 19.\", }, Once you've got your mod and settings registered, they will appear in the settings menu. The user will be able to change them, and their values will be stored to the disk. To query the value of a setting, use GetOptionValue(mod: string, setting: string) . For checkboxes this returns boolean , for other elements it's number . Dropdowns use 1-based indexing! (1 = first option) . You can also set the stored value (or hook GetOptionValue ). If you do this, keep in mind that it will not be automatically saved to disk. if (Minimap.visible ~= Client.UI.OptionsSettings.GetOptionValue(\"EpipEncounters\", \"Minimap\")) then Client.UI.OptionsSettings.SetOptionValue(\"EpipEncounters\", \"Minimap\", Minimap.visible) Client.UI.OptionsSettings.SaveSettings() end You may use the IsElementEnabled hook to make elements in your menu non-interactable.

It is accessed from its own settings tab in the settings menu. Creating Effects \u00b6 An Effect is a perk that an enemy can roll if Epic Enemies is enabled. Effects can belong to a category; each category gets their own settings sliders for all its effects in the UI. If you wish to add effects, you should register your own category for them with RegisterEffectCategory() . You may define the effects while defining the category (of type EpicEnemiesEffect ), and they will be automatically registered as well. Registering effects directly with RegisterEffect() does not bind them to any category by default, meaning they will not appear in the UI and will not be customizable - this is great if you wish to create auxiliary effects with 0 weight and script their applications yourself. Effects can be rolled on a character with InitializeCharacter() . By default, this happens when they enter combat, and numerous characters are excluded: players, summons, and already initialized characters. You may tag characters with PIP_EpicEnemies_Ineligible to exclude them as well. Effects from a character can be removed with CleanupCharacter() ; this will cause their stat boosts, Special Logic, and other perks from their effects to be cleaned up as well. By default, this only happens when lua is reset (for debugging). When InitializeCharacter() is called, effects are rolled randomly based on their weight and eligibility . You may hook IsEffectApplicable to control which effects a character can receive. The EpicEnemiesEffectTemplates feature script does so to prevent keyword mutators from being granted to characters that do not possess an activator effect. The EpicEnemiesEffectTemplates feature script also implements multiple types of effects that power generic functionality: SpecialLogic Artifacts Summons Statuses ExtendedStats FlexStats RequiredSkills This is done by extending the the EpicEnemiesEffect class into EpicEnemiesExtendedEffect - you need only to add its extra fields to your effect definitions, and the event listeners from that script will take care of making them work. Of course, you may also add functionality yourself the same way, as detailed in the next section. Scripting Effects \u00b6 Effects can be in 2 states: applied and activated. \"Applied\" means the character has the effect, but its benefits are dormant and not yet active. \"Activated\" effects grant their benefits (stats, Special Logic, etc.). The condition for effects is based on the ActivationCondition field. If unspecified, it defaults to the \"EffectApplied\" type, which causes the effect to be activated as soon as it is applied (during initialization). If you specify a custom ActivationCondition , you will have to activate the effect's perks manually. The EpicEnemiesEffectConditions feature script implements some custom ActivationConditions: TurnStart : effect activates at the start of X turn, optionally repeating (effects support multiple activations). HealthThreshold : effect activates when beneath a Vitality/Armor threshold. BatteredHarried : effect activates upon reaching X B/H. StatusGained : effect activates upon gaining a certain status. Activation attempts are done through the ActivateEffects() call, which takes an ActivationCondition type (the string ID) as well as some params (for example, activation attemps of BatteredHarried pass the B/H stack count). This call in turn invokes the CanActivateEffect hook where scripts must judge if the parameters of the activation attempt are correct to activate each of the effects with that ActivationCondition. Example of how TurnStart works: A PROC_AMER_Combat_TurnStarted listener calls ActivateEffects(char, \"TurnStart\", {Round = round}) The EpicEnemies main script invokes the CanActivateEffect hook for each effect with the corresponding ActivationCondition type, as well as the params from the ActivateEffects() call. A listener of said hook checks if the activation condition type is \"TurnStart\", and if it is, returns a boolean indicating if the params received match the conditions defined in the effect. For example, the following effect activates on turn 2, meaning the enemy only becomes hasted on turn 2, since the listeners that manage the TurnStart activation condition compare Round and Repeat with the parameters from the activation attempt. The effect is however always visible in the tooltip, along with its activation condition, so players can plan around it. { Name = \"TurnStart Activation Test\", ID = \"TestStatus2\", Description = \"Hasted on turn 2.\", Status = { StatusID = \"HASTED\", Duration = 2, }, ActivationCondition = { Type = \"TurnStart\", Round = 2, Repeat = false, }, }, Events/Hooks \u00b6 ---@hook GetActivationConditionDescription ---@field RegisterHook fun(self, handler:fun(text:string, condition:EpicEnemiesActivationCondition, char:EclCharacter)) ---@field Return fun(self, text:string, condition:EpicEnemiesActivationCondition, char:EclCharacter) ---@event EffectApplied ---@field RegisterListener fun(self, listener:fun(char:EsvCharacter, effect:EpicEnemiesEffect)) ---@field Fire fun(self, char:EsvCharacter, effect:EpicEnemiesEffect) ---@event EffectRemoved ---@field RegisterListener fun(self, listener:fun(char:EsvCharacter, effect:EpicEnemiesEffect)) ---@field Fire fun(self, char:EsvCharacter, effect:EpicEnemiesEffect) ---@hook IsEligible ---@field RegisterHook fun(self, handler:fun(eligible:boolean, char:EsvCharacter)) ---@field Return fun(self, eligible:boolean, char:EsvCharacter) ---@hook IsEffectApplicable ---@field RegisterHook fun(self, handler:fun(applicable:boolean, effect:EpicEnemiesEffect, char:EsvCharacter, activeEffects:EpicEnemiesEffect[])) ---@field Return fun(self, applicable:boolean, effect:EpicEnemiesEffect, char:EsvCharacter, activeEffects:EpicEnemiesEffect[]) ---@event EffectActivated ---@field RegisterListener fun(self, listener:fun(char:EsvCharacter, effect:EpicEnemiesEffect)) ---@field Fire fun(self, char:EsvCharacter, effect:EpicEnemiesEffect) ---@event EffectDeactivated ---@field RegisterListener fun(self, listener:fun(char:EsvCharacter, effect:EpicEnemiesEffect)) ---@field Fire fun(self, char:EsvCharacter, effect:EpicEnemiesEffect) ---@hook CanActivateEffect ---@field RegisterHook fun(self, handler:fun(activate:boolean, char:EsvCharacter, effect:EpicEnemiesEffect, params:any)) ---@field Return fun(self, activate:boolean, char:EsvCharacter, effect:EpicEnemiesEffect, params:any) ---@hook GetPointsForCharacter ---@field RegisterHook fun(self, handler:fun(points:integer, char:EsvCharacter)) ---@field Return fun(self, points:integer, char:EsvCharacter) ---@event CharacterInitialized ---@field RegisterListener fun(self, listener:fun(char:EsvCharacter, effects:EpicEnemiesEffect[])) ---@field Fire fun(self, char:EsvCharacter, effects:EpicEnemiesEffect[]) ---@event CharacterCleanedUp ---@field RegisterListener fun(self, listener:fun(char:EsvCharacter)) ---@field Fire fun(self, char:EsvCharacter) Methods \u00b6 function EpicEnemies.IsInitialized(char) ---@param char EsvCharacter function EpicEnemies.InitializeCharacter(char) ---Remove all effects from a character. ---@param char EsvCharacter function EpicEnemies.CleanupCharacter(char) ---Returns true if the character is eligible to receive Epic Enemies effects. ---@param char EsvCharacter function EpicEnemies.IsEligible(char) ---@param char EsvCharacter ---@param effect EpicEnemiesEffect function EpicEnemies.ApplyEffect(char, effect) ---@param char EsvCharacter ---@param effect EpicEnemiesEffect function EpicEnemies.ActivateEffect(char, effect) ---@param char EsvCharacter ---@param predicate fun(char:EsvCharacter, effect:EpicEnemiesEffect)? ---@return table<string, EpicEnemiesEffect> function EpicEnemies.GetAppliedEffects(char, predicate) ---@param char EsvCharacter ---@param effect EpicEnemiesCharacter ---@return boolean function EpicEnemies.EffectIsActive(char, effect) ---@param char EsvCharacter ---@param effect EpicEnemiesCharacter ---@return integer function EpicEnemies.GetEffectActivationCount(char, effect) ---@param char EsvCharacter ---@param effectType string ---@param params table? function EpicEnemies.ActivateEffects(char, effectType, params) ---@param char EsvCharacter ---@param effect EpicEnemiesEffect ---@param charges integer?

The effect is however always visible in the tooltip, along with its activation condition, so players can plan around it. { Name = \"TurnStart Activation Test\", ID = \"TestStatus2\", Description = \"Hasted on turn 2.\", Status = { StatusID = \"HASTED\", Duration = 2, }, ActivationCondition = { Type = \"TurnStart\", Round = 2, Repeat = false, }, },","title":"Scripting Effects"},{"location":"Epip/EpicEnemies/#eventshooks","text":"---@hook GetActivationConditionDescription ---@field RegisterHook fun(self, handler:fun(text:string, condition:EpicEnemiesActivationCondition, char:EclCharacter)) ---@field Return fun(self, text:string, condition:EpicEnemiesActivationCondition, char:EclCharacter) ---@event EffectApplied ---@field RegisterListener fun(self, listener:fun(char:EsvCharacter, effect:EpicEnemiesEffect)) ---@field Fire fun(self, char:EsvCharacter, effect:EpicEnemiesEffect) ---@event EffectRemoved ---@field RegisterListener fun(self, listener:fun(char:EsvCharacter, effect:EpicEnemiesEffect)) ---@field Fire fun(self, char:EsvCharacter, effect:EpicEnemiesEffect) ---@hook IsEligible ---@field RegisterHook fun(self, handler:fun(eligible:boolean, char:EsvCharacter)) ---@field Return fun(self, eligible:boolean, char:EsvCharacter) ---@hook IsEffectApplicable ---@field RegisterHook fun(self, handler:fun(applicable:boolean, effect:EpicEnemiesEffect, char:EsvCharacter, activeEffects:EpicEnemiesEffect[])) ---@field Return fun(self, applicable:boolean, effect:EpicEnemiesEffect, char:EsvCharacter, activeEffects:EpicEnemiesEffect[]) ---@event EffectActivated ---@field RegisterListener fun(self, listener:fun(char:EsvCharacter, effect:EpicEnemiesEffect)) ---@field Fire fun(self, char:EsvCharacter, effect:EpicEnemiesEffect) ---@event EffectDeactivated ---@field RegisterListener fun(self, listener:fun(char:EsvCharacter, effect:EpicEnemiesEffect)) ---@field Fire fun(self, char:EsvCharacter, effect:EpicEnemiesEffect) ---@hook CanActivateEffect ---@field RegisterHook fun(self, handler:fun(activate:boolean, char:EsvCharacter, effect:EpicEnemiesEffect, params:any)) ---@field Return fun(self, activate:boolean, char:EsvCharacter, effect:EpicEnemiesEffect, params:any) ---@hook GetPointsForCharacter ---@field RegisterHook fun(self, handler:fun(points:integer, char:EsvCharacter)) ---@field Return fun(self, points:integer, char:EsvCharacter) ---@event CharacterInitialized ---@field RegisterListener fun(self, listener:fun(char:EsvCharacter, effects:EpicEnemiesEffect[])) ---@field Fire fun(self, char:EsvCharacter, effects:EpicEnemiesEffect[]) ---@event CharacterCleanedUp ---@field RegisterListener fun(self, listener:fun(char:EsvCharacter)) ---@field Fire fun(self, char:EsvCharacter)","title":"Events/Hooks"},{"location":"Epip/EpicEnemies/#methods","text":"function EpicEnemies.IsInitialized(char) ---@param char EsvCharacter function EpicEnemies.InitializeCharacter(char) ---Remove all effects from a character. ---@param char EsvCharacter function EpicEnemies.CleanupCharacter(char) ---Returns true if the character is eligible to receive Epic Enemies effects. ---@param char EsvCharacter function EpicEnemies.IsEligible(char) ---@param char EsvCharacter ---@param effect EpicEnemiesEffect function EpicEnemies.ApplyEffect(char, effect) ---@param char EsvCharacter ---@param effect EpicEnemiesEffect function EpicEnemies.ActivateEffect(char, effect) ---@param char EsvCharacter ---@param predicate fun(char:EsvCharacter, effect:EpicEnemiesEffect)? ---@return table<string, EpicEnemiesEffect> function EpicEnemies.GetAppliedEffects(char, predicate) ---@param char EsvCharacter ---@param effect EpicEnemiesCharacter ---@return boolean function EpicEnemies.EffectIsActive(char, effect) ---@param char EsvCharacter ---@param effect EpicEnemiesCharacter ---@return integer function EpicEnemies.GetEffectActivationCount(char, effect) ---@param char EsvCharacter ---@param effectType string ---@param params table? function EpicEnemies.ActivateEffects(char, effectType, params) ---@param char EsvCharacter ---@param effect EpicEnemiesEffect ---@param charges integer?

Is this decoupling overengineered? Possibly, but it's a good showcase of how easily extensible systems can be if you stuff them with events. TODO document the rest of the system - Only Shared.lua is here atm. Creating Stats \u00b6 There's 3 steps to creating a stat. Steps 1 and 2 have to be done on both contexts. Define the stat; it's name, tooltip, how it displays, etc. Put it into a category (or create one for it) Set/update it's value when requested, through RegisterStatValueHook You can define a stat with RegisterStat(id: string, data: EpipStat) . The structure of a stat is the following: ---@class EpipStat ---@field Name string ---@field Description string Fallback description in case a formatted Tooltip isn't set. ---@field Tooltip TooltipData ---@field Footnote string Italic text after description, in new paragraph. ---@field Suffix string Suffix for value display. ---@field Prefix string Prefix for value display. ---@field Boolean boolean Boolean stats show no value label. ---@field MaxCharges string If specified, this stat will display as \"{Value}/{Value of MaxCharges stat}\" ---@field IgnoreForHiding boolean If true, this stat will not be considered as added when determining if a Hidden category should display. StatsTab.RegisterStat(\"RegenLifeCalculated\", { Name = \"Missing Life Regen\", Description = \"Restores a percentage of your missing Vitality at the start of your turn.\", Footnote = \"Missing Regeneration is capped at 50%.\", Suffix = \"%\", }) Next, you need to append it into a category with AddStatToCategory(statID: string, categoryID: string, index?: integer) . You can omit index and it will be placed at the bottom. StatsTab.AddStatToCategory(\"RegenLifeCalculated\", \"Vitals\") Finally, you need to register a hook to update the stat's value. This can be done in 2 ways: on client or on server (do not do both). If the stat's value can be queried from the client context, you only need a simple hook on the client: StatsTab.RegisterStatValueHook(\"PartyFunds_Gold\", function(value, data, char) return Game.Items.GetPartyTemplateCount(\"LOOT_Gold_A_1c3c9c74-34a1-4685-989e-410dc080be6f\") end) For stats that require info from the server, there is a special system in place that synchronizes stat values with tags. To set a stat's value from the server context, you need to use a different event (note it's not a hook, you must call UpdateTaggedStat yourself). On the client, the stat's value will be queried automatically from such tag if it is set; the advantage here being that there is no need to request stats from the server every time the tab is opened. StatsTab.RegisterStatUpdateListener(\"Keyword_VitalityVoid_Power\", function(char, data) Osi.QRY_AMER_KeywordStat_VitalityVoid_GetPower(char.MyGuid, 1) local value = Osi.DB_AMER_KeywordStat_OUTPUT_Real:Get(nil)[1][1] * 100 EpipStats.UpdateTaggedStat(char, \"Keyword_VitalityVoid_Power\", value) end) Creating Ascension Node Stats \u00b6 Stats related to Ascension nodes are automatically updated if their ID follows a specific format. All you need to do is define one; no further event listeners required. It will also be automatically put into the relevant keyword's category. You can create such stat with StatsTab.AddNodeStat(clusterId: string, nodeIndex: number, nodeSubIndex: number, keyword: Keyword, keywordType: KeywordBoonType, statData: EpipStat) . StatData is the stat definition, like with a normal stat. The indexes are 0-based. ClusterId is the ID of the Aspect, ex. Force_TheFalcon . There's just one small catch: owned nodes are only tracked if there's a stat defined for them. When you add stats in an update, you should call StatsTab.RecalculateNodeStats() on the server during the patch routine. You can also call NRD_ModCall(\"EpipEncounters\", \"PerformFullStatsUpdate\"); from Osiris, but this will be removed in the future. Creating Categories \u00b6 A category holds stats, and can be collapsed in the menu. Stats only render if they're within a category that is open. They can be added with RegisterCategory(id: string, data: EpipStatCategory, index?: integer) . See the EpipStatCategory struct. StatsTab.RegisterCategory(\"Vitals\", { Header = \"<font size='21'>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Vitals \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</font>\", Name = \"Vitals\", Behaviour = \"GreyOut\", Stats = { \"RegenLifeCalculated\", \"RegenPhysicalArmorCalculated\", \"RegenMagicArmorCalculated\", \"LifeSteal\", }, }) Modifying Stats \u00b6 Stat definitions are stored in StatsTab.STATS .

Unlike some other implementations, this has absolutely no gameplay side effects . It even works with Gift Bag 5 armor sets! Access its menu by right-clicking any of your equipped items and choosing the \"Vanity...\" option. From here you will have access to a number of tabs packed with customization features. Transmog tab \u00b6 Equipment tab lets you seamlessly transmogrify the appearance of your weapons and armors. The item you've used to access this tab is its focus, indicated by the dropdown list at the top. To select another item to tinker with you can use right-click -> Vanity... on it or said dropdown list. Basics \u00b6 Transmog options consist of vanilla armor variants and options added by cosmetic mods. Support is included for \"Majora's Project Fashion Sins\" , \"Rendal's NPC Armors\" and \"Visitors from Cyseal\" mods. Using transmog is as easy as clicking on your desired option, no extra items or materials required. This change is purely cosmetic and has no effect on gameplay! Your equipment will not lose its stats, modifiers nor set effects. Yes, it works with Gift Bag 5 armor sets. If you think we've missed some of vanilla variants or want to see support for more third-party mods - feel free to tell us. Autotransmog \u00b6 Found your perfect look? Want to keep it for the rest of the game? \"Lock Appearance\" option is here for you. When it's ticked newly equipped gear will be automatically transmogrified to match your previous look. This option is saved per-slot. Automatic transmogrification will only happen if you don't have Vanity menu open. Visibility \u00b6 Want to go for more outlandish look? Make your equipment invisible with a press of a button! We trust you to use this option responsibly and only hide your shields and/or weapons for the coolness factor instead of making your characters walk around butt-naked. Keep icon \u00b6 For the sake of making inventory management easier you can make transmog - both manual and automatic - preserve equipment icon. This option is saved per-slot. Elemental effects \u00b6 Weapons with elemental damage normally get glowing visual effect applied to them. Don't like it? You can turn it off. Outfits tab \u00b6 Have you mastered the art of drip? Have you found your ultimate image? Never wanna wear anything else ever again? Save your entire get-up and use it across playthroughs with a few clicks. Saved outfits are grouped by intended race and gender, but can be applied to any character. Adding a new outfit to your wardrobe is as simple as clicking and entering a name. Dyes tab \u00b6 Feeling blue today? Maybe red? Or are you cool and it's time for purple? Worry not! All your coloring needs can be satisfied in the Dyes tab! Basics \u00b6 Equipment is divided in up to 3 color zones. You can choose your favorite colors for each of them using means provided: Sliders - the more user-friendly option, drag a bunch of sliders around to adjust RGB values in [0; 255] range. You don't even have to understand how RGB works - a handy preview of a resulting color is always displayed for your convenience. Hex - if you think you're cool you can always straight-up enter your desired hex code. Whether you conjure them in your mind through otherwordly communion or just look them up in Google - not our problem. Once done - press to see the fruits of your labor. Important - not all equipment can be dyed and not all dyeable equipment will have all 3 color zones. We are not to be blamed for this, blame Larian instead. Sharing \u00b6 Found the coolest color combination ever? Wanna share it with your friend? There are several ways to go about this: Copy/paste - see these ? Up means \"copy\", down means \"paste\". Import/export - puts a single string representing all 3 color zones into your clipboard, kinda like this #FF0000-#00FF00-#0000FF . scans your clipboard and if it contains the string in correct format - inputs color codes into their zones. Lock sliders \u00b6 By default color sliders will automatically adjust to match currently focused equipment piece whenever you change it. However by ticking you can prevent this. This can be useful for applying one dye to multiple equipment pieces. Saving dyes and built-ins \u00b6 You can save your favorite dyes to reuse them later by pressing and entering a name. Saved dyes will appear under \"Custom Dyes\" collapsing list. There also are a few built-in dyes for you to use or take inspiration from. Auras tab \u00b6 All these drip options were not enough for you? Want to make your presence even more noticeable? Apply permanent visual effects to your character in Auras tab. As simple as it gets - choose your attachment point, choose auras to use with it. This feature is in rather experimental stage. It works as intended, but has seen little adoption by players (to our knowledge).

A useful shorthand for the function is _D() : As of v56, all extender objects can be dumped as well, revealing their mapped properties and methods: The _C() function is a shorthand for returning the currently active character, available on both client and server. S >> print(_C()) esv::Character (00007FF4C7E13200) Note that this returns an extender character object ( esv::Character ), not the GUID. The GUID of most objects is mapped to the .MyGuid property, and it's what you have to use for osiris: The boolean type is automatically converted to 0 / 1 when used in a call, but queries will still return integers. On the client context, _E() returns the character currently being examined in the examine UI. Epip Helpers \u00b6 Epip has some easy-to-use features to make testing ingame easier, if DeveloperMode is set to true in OsirisExtenderSettings.json .

This and other debug settings are always at the top of the menu, only visible in developer mode. The other useful, non-UI-related tool is the cheat context menu, accessed by right-clicking a character in the world or a player portrait on the left: The \"Copy GUID to clipboard\" option is self-explanatory. \"Teleport to object\" teleports the character to another character, item, or trigger, by its GUID. You can combine these two options to quickly teleport party members to eachother. \"Pipmode\" grants immortality, instantly-refreshing cooldowns, as well as infinite AP and SP. The options following it allow you to grant EE scripted stats to the character, with +/- buttons. Holding the \"Show sneak cones\" key (shift by default) adds/removes 10 points at a time. The longer menus can be scrolled with the mouse wheel, though it doesn't look intuitive at the moment.

It is intended to teach you how to use lua with the Script Extender assuming no prior knowledge of the language, just programming basics (variables, control structures, classes etc.) Introduction \u00b6 Lua is an interpreted, functional, dynamically-typed language with possibility for prototype-based object-oriented programming. It is intended to be embedded within other applications (in this case, within the extender/game), offering high-level scripting. In the context of the Script Extender, it offers new forms of interaction with the game by allowing read/write access to the internal game object classes, as well as additional events to listen for. Setup \u00b6 Lua scripts are stored within the Mods/MyMod-GUID/Story/RawFiles/Lua folder and are loaded if the mod is active. Prior to creating lua scripts, you must enable the functionality by configuring a OsiToolsConfig.json file within the Mods/MyMod-GUID folder. The basic configuration is the following: { \"RequiredExtensionVersion\": 56, \"ModTable\": \"MyMod\", \"FeatureFlags\": [ \"OsirisExtensions\", \"Lua\", \"Preprocessor\" ] } Fields: - RequiredExtensionVersion : determines the minimum Script Extender version that the mod requires. Set this to the current version as of the time of your mod's creation, and increment it as you start using features from later versions. An error message box will be shown to users if they try to use your mod with an outdated Script Extender. - ModTable : determines the lua table that your mod's variables will be put into. Set this to a unique identifier. We'll get to its use later. - FeatureFlags : determines which features of the extender your mod requires; OsirisExtensions and Preprocessor are optional, but helpful if intend to you complement your lua scripting with Story scripting. After you've setup the config file, you're ready to create your first lua script. When the game loads mods, the extender will automatically load the BootstrapClient.lua and BootstrapServer.lua scripts within the RawFiles/Lua/ folder, if they exist. These are the first scripts to be loaded, and the scripts from which you will import any additional ones. The reasoning behind there being 2 different bootstrap scripts is that internally, the game is split into 2 \"contexts\": - Server: the part of the game that runs nearly all the logic (ex. damage calculations, Story scripting) and lets players connect to it. - Client: the game application that connects to the server, displays the game state and allows user interaction. In human words, the game window. Each game instance is one client (players in splitscreen use the same client). As the 2 contexts server different purposes, they differ in the information that is accessible in each. For example, the user interface (character sheet, inventory, etc.) only exists for clients, while Story scripting only runs on the server. As such, lua scripting is also split between Client and Server scripting so you can cleanly separate your functionality based on context. Lua Basics \u00b6 Variables \u00b6 Lua is an interpreted, dynamically-typed language. This means there is no need to compile it, the raw .lua file is loaded by the extender and interpreted line-by-line. Being dynamically-typed means that variables do not need to be declared with a type, and instead can be assigned and reassigned freely to any value, as is the case in Python for example. Variables are declared and assigned as the following (semicolons at the end of lines are optional): local myVar = 1 The local keyword is optional, and restricts the variable to the current context (the function/file, more precisely a \"chunk\"). Non-local variables are global. The following types exist in lua: - nil (null) - number - integer (in latest versions) - string - function - table - userdata (garbage-collected values also accessible from C) - lightuserdata (C pointers) The concept of the first few should be familiar, while the latter are more lua-specific and we'll cover them later, for now focusing instead on functions and tables. Functions \u00b6 Functions can be defined in multiple ways, the simplest one being: function MyFunc(param1, param2) -- Code here! end Note that comments in lua start with 2 dashes ( -- ). Functions can be given the local modifier as well, and any number of arguments, with no type specification. It is important to note that as lua is not a class-based language, there is no overloading. Creating a new function MyFunc after the first one will override that function no matter if its signature is different. Additionally, since functions are types, assigning MyFunc = something will also override the function! Lua functions can also be called with any amount of parameters, regardless of definition - we'll go into more detail on that quirk later. Functions and tables are passed by reference. (TODO remark that this does not mean you can \"alter\" them outside their context) Tables \u00b6 Tables are lua's take on objects . If you've done JavaScript or other prototype-based languages, they will be easy to understand. A table-type variable is defined, in its simplest form, like this: local myTable = {} Tables are the basic, extendable object in lua. You may set and retrieve values on them by indexing them: myTable[\"key1\"] = 1 -- This also works (if no spaces or special characters) myTable.key2 = 2 print(myTable.key1) print(myTable[\"key2\"]) Working with the Extender \u00b6 Events \u00b6 So far the tutorial has introduced lua basics, but with no explanation on how we'll be interfacing with the game with it. Lua scripting in the extender is primarily event-driven, as is Story scripting. You register listener functions for built-in events to react to things occurring in the game.
