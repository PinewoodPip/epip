Special thanks to: Ameranth for programming help as well as the amazing moddability of EE Derpy Moa for motivation and initial ideas Norbyte for the Script Extender and it's fantastic UI features Elric for his help with designing and drawing new UIs Download Requires Norbyte's Script Extender . Load after both EE Core and EE Origins. Only English is supported. Text related to gameplay changes will not show up in other languages. Mods that also modify UI are largely incompatible. \"No More Dragging\" and its expanded container version is compatible, for now. Latest stable version, v1043 Features Health Bar The health bar at the top of the screen now shows a character\u2019s resistances as well as their Battered and Harried stacks. The B/H icons will light up if the target has enough of them to suffer a Tier 3 status, and will blink when the duration of the stacks is 1 turn or fewer. The actual B/H statuses are now hidden in this UI to reduce clutter. Credits to Elric for the new art assets used! Holding the \"show sneak cones\" button (shift by default) will replace the resistances display with the character\u2019s current AP, Source and Initiative - very handy for planning and foreseeing enemy turns. Additionally, it will lower the opacity of status effects on the health bar. The health bar above the hotbar now shows its values at all times (you needn't hover over it anymore), and the Physical/Magic Armor text is removed to improve readability. Character Sheets Your physical and piercing resistances are now shown on the character sheet. The tags tab is replaced with a brand new \"Keywords and misc.\" tab. You can use it to quickly reference your keyword activators and mutators, as well as reaction charges remaining. The examine menu now shows Critical Chance, and can be configured to open on the sides of the screen rather than the middle. Tooltip Improvements Item Tooltips The damage stat tooltip in the character sheet now distinguishes the multiplicative bonuses from weapon abilities, and the obsolete Lone Wolf texts are removed. \"Stat Adjustments\" from EE scripting are merged into a single line in tooltips. Long item tooltips will try to fit the screen better, eliminating the issue of being unable to compare items while wielding a heavily upgraded item. Artifacts display with a special rarity and item color, hand-picked by the EE devs. This change has been made available in the base EE mod as well. Additionally, artifact runes now show a \"Cannot equip.\" warning for slots that they are incompatible with. Pieces of equipment with randomly-rolled stats now display a \"Quality\" rating, indicating how well their base damage or armor rolled. A 100% Quality rating is exclusive to Divine items. Their tooltips now also show if they have been Masterworked. The prefix \"Set:\" from modifiers is removed to lessen confusion. The weapon range modifier is now clearly shown amongst the others, and the range at the bottom distinguishes the base weapon range and the added bonus. Skill Tooltips While preparing an infusion or holding the shift key, skill tooltips will highlight unmet Source Infusion requirements in red. Holding the shift key will also display the damage multiplier of skills. Effects that alter the AP costs of skills globally will be reflected appropriately in tooltips. Status Tooltips Tooltips for damaging statuses now display the damage they will deal approximately, rather than showing the base damage before any modifiers. Context Menus Epip Encounters adds fancy new context menu tech that powers numerous QoL features. You can Dismantle, Extract Runes and Dye items directly from item context menus. Destructive actions require shift+clicking to confirm for items that are equipped. Containers with equipment in them get a \"Mass Dismantle\" option, letting you rapidly dismantle unwanted gear. A vanity feature is also included. Equipment can also be transmogrified from context menus into any obtainable item visual in the game. The available visuals are sorted into categories and filtered down to show only the ones compatible with your character's race and gender. Outfits can be saved and loaded across different profiles, and support for Majora's Project Fashion Sins is included, offering possibly the most convenient way so far to enjoy its ridiculous amount of assets. A cheat context menu is also available for characters if developer mode is enabled. It may also be accessed from the player portraits's context menu. It includes numerous handy functions, including teleports, copying GUIDs to clipboard, adding EE stats, spawning templates/loot tables, a godmode, and more. Player Portraits The status bar on your characters now wraps onto a second row once there are more than 6 statuses, preventing it from obscuring the middle of the screen during intense fights. Summon portraits no longer show statuses and are shrunk while the status bar is wrapping. You can right-click your portraits to open a context menu where you can hide the status bar and summons, as well as access the Debug Cheats if you're in developer mode. In the settings, you may also enable a Battered/Harried display on these portraits. Hotbar Epip Encounters expands the hotbar to allow multiple rows of slots and customizable buttons in the bottom left area. To add/remove rows, click the small +/- icons to the right of the buttons area. You can cycle each row independently through all 5 rows of slots that the game allows. You can have up to 5 rows visible. You can use the regular hotkeys (F/R) to cycle the bottom bar. Holding shift (Toggle Sneak Cones) while using them will cycle the second row from the bottom instead. The buttons next to the portrait are now customizable; when your hotbar is unlocked, you can drag and drop to rearrange them. Additionally, mods can add their own \"actions\" there, and there are a few new built-in ones. You can press the middle mouse button to unbind them. Right click one of those buttons or click the ^ button to bring up a \"drawer\" with all the actions that you can drag and drop onto your actions bar. You can also click them to use them directly from there. These buttons can be used with keyboard hotkeys; to do so, you must assign keys to them from the game\u2019s input options menu. They are labelled \"Hotbar Custom Hotkey #N\" there. By default, if you have 2+ rows of hotbar slots, you will also have a second row of these customizable buttons. You can disable this from the settings menu. Epip Encounters implements multiple handy new actions, in addition to some vanilla functions: Source Infuse & Meditate Toggle Minimap Resting (using a bedroll from anywhere in your party inventory - no need to find one for everyone!) Toggle Party Link (instantaneous, no animation!) Respec (if Portable Respec Mirror mod is installed) Access Cheat Commander (with the EE version of the mod) The purpose of the action bar is to provide a centralized place for modders to add shortcuts/hotkeys to their interfaces or features, eliminating the need for interactable books that clutter your inventory and freeing up space on the hotbar. Settings Epip Encounters implements an in-game settings menu to toggle or customize certain features. Noteworthy settings are: Immersive Meditation: hides the minimap and hotbar while you're using the EE interfaces. Skill-casting Notifications: allows you to disable the \"Enemy has cast Skill\" toasts. Auto-identify items: automatically identifies new items found, using the party's highest Loremaster score. Can also be configured to ignore Loremaster entirely. Fog of war: the dark shroud in unexplored areas can be turned off. If turned back on, your \"exploration progress\" is preserved. The size and duration of overhead text and damage can be adjusted. For developers: options for logging of UI calls/invokes, and forcing story patching. Miscellaneous Changes Notifications from characters casting skills in combat are repositioned to show above the hotbar, so as not to obscure the enemy health bars. They can also be disabled in the settings.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#epip-encounters","text":"Epip Encounters is an add-on mod for Epic Encounters 2 which introduces numerous Quality of Life changes as well as UI improvements.

Since late 2021, the focus of development has shifted to making the internals of the mod available as libraries, aiming to provide utility, better maintainability, extendability and easy manipulation of UIs from lua. The ultimate goal is to make the mod easy for someone else to continue working on after/if I depart - EE is an overhaul built to last and be tinkered with, and I would like to honor that in my own project. This change will be a long process. There are still many features of the mod that remain to be rewritten to the new standards and methodology, or extended to provide functionality beyond what the current mod needs. Anything that is documented here is considered stable and unlikely to change drastically - any changes to these calls/systems will be mentioned in future patch notes. The definitions here are auto-generated from EmmyLua annotations within the scripts (using update_docs.py found in the mod). Functions are tagged through @meta to denote tags like \"Client-only\", \"EE-only\". Declaring these at the top of the file tags all functions in the file. Introduction The mod's root table contains the following tables: Epip : stores references to \"Features\" and metadata related to the mod. Game : contains libraries for querying information of characters, items and other contexts relating to the game. Client : contains client-specific calls as well as tables offering UI-specific calls, events and hooks. Utilities : contains utility methods useful across many contexts. The scripting in Epip Encounters focuses on event-driven programming. Aside from functions, systems and features tend to implement events and hooks which allow other scripts to react to them being raised. Event listeners allow you to react to events sent from scripts. They can receive parameters and are executed in the order that they were registered. -- Listen for the shift key being pressed/unpressed. Client.Input:RegisterListener(\"SneakConesToggled\", function(pressed) print(\"Sneak cones toggled: \" .. pressed) end) Hooks are similar to event listeners, but are used to modify values calculated within functions. Their purpose is to allow scripts to alter the logic or output of functions. A hook is always passed a \"default value\" as its first parameter, which will be used if no listeners choose to act upon the event. Any script can implement events/hooks, and it's easy to add \"parameters\" to registering listeners as well, to filter their execution conditonally. -- Set opacity for Battered/Harried stack backgrounds in the health bar based on if the amount if enough to inflict a T3. Client.UI.EnemyHealthBar:RegisterHook(\"GetStackOpacity\", function(opacity, stack, amount) local threshold = Game.Character.GetStacksNeededToInflictTier3(Client.GetCharacter()) if amount >= threshold then opacity = 1 elseif amount == 0 then opacity = 0.5 else opacity = 0.75 end return opacity end) Hooks are not limited to changing primitives, they are often also used in UI scripts to allow for manipulation of the data that the engine is passing it, parsed into handy tables. The following example adds Critical Chance to the Examine UI. -- Add Critical Chance to the examine menu when its data is being updated. Client.UI.Examine:RegisterHook(\"Update\", function(examineData) local char = Client.UI.Examine.GetCharacter() -- Only do this for characters being examined if char then local critEntry = { id = 9, label = \"Critical Chance\", iconID = Client.UI.Examine.ICONS.CRITICAL_CHANCE, value = string.format(\"%d%%\", char.Stats.CriticalChance), type = Client.UI.Examine.ENTRY_TYPES.STAT, } -- Insert crit chance after damage local damageElement,damageIndex,damageCategory = examineData:GetElement(4, 6) examineData:InsertElement(damageCategory.id, critEntry, damageIndex + 1) end return examineData end) Aliases The following EmmyLua aliases are defined (in EpipIdeHelpers.lua ): ---@alias Entity EclCharacter | EsvCharacter | EclItem | EsvItem ---@alias Character EsvCharacter | EclCharacter ---@alias Item EclItem | EsvItem ---@alias EquipSlot \"Helmet\" | \"Breast\" | \"Leggings\" | \"Weapon\" | \"Shield\" | \"Ring\" | \"Belt\" | \"Boots\" | \"Gloves\" | \"Amulet\" | \"Ring\" | \"Ring2\" | \"Horns\" | \"Overhead\" ---@alias EquipmentSubType \"Platemail\" | \"Robes\" | \"Leather\" | \"Belt\" | \"Ring\" | \"Amulet\" | \"Shield\" | \"Dagger\" | \"Sword\" | \"Axe\" | \"Mace\" | \"Sword\" | \"Spear\" | \"Staff\" | \"Bow\" | \"Crossbow\" | \"Wand\" ---@alias StackType \"Battered\" | \"B\" | \"Harried\" | \"H\" ---@alias Gender \"Male\" | \"Female\" ---@alias Race \"Human\" | \"Elf\" | \"Dwarf\" | \"Lizard\" ---@alias Keyword \"ViolentStrike\" | \"VitalityVoid\" | \"Predator\" | \"Elementalist\" | \"Prosperity\" | \"Paucity\" | \"IncarnateChampion\" | \"Defiance\" | \"Occultist\" | \"Disintegrate\" | \"Wither\" | \"Centurion\" | \"Abeyance\" | \"Benevolence\" | \"Presence\" | \"Ward\" | \"Celestial\" | \"Purity\" | \"VolatileArmor\" | \"Voracity\" ---@alias KeywordBoonType \"Activator\" | \"Mutator\" -- For doc generation; does not actually work in IDE ---@class Event ---@class Hook --------------------------------------------- -- UI --------------------------------------------- ---@alias MessageBoxType \"Message\" | \"Input\" --------------------------------------------- -- GAME.TOOLTIP --------------------------------------------- ---@class TooltipData ---@field Data table[] ---@param data table[] ---@return TooltipData function TooltipData:Create(data) end ---@param type string ---@return table function TooltipData:GetElement(type) end ---@param type string ---@return table[] function TooltipData:GetElements(type) end ---@param type string function TooltipData:RemoveElements(type) end ---@param type string function TooltipData:RemoveElement(type) end ---@param ele table function TooltipData:AppendElement(ele) end ---@param ele table ---@param appendAfter table function TooltipData:AppendElementAfter(ele, appendAfter) end","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"docs/#documentation","text":"The features of Epip Encounters are built on top of a lot of trial-and-error research and work on client-side scripting and UI modding.

Requires v56 of the extender! This version of the extender is not public yet, you have to install it manually: To get it, create a file named OsiUpdateChannel.txt in the same directory where you installed the extender (where DXGI.dll is) with the contents: Devel Workshop page HERE Extra Bars To add more bars, click the small +/- buttons between the buttons and the slots. You may cycle each bar independently. The original cycling hotkeys cycle the bottom bar; holding shift while doing so (the \"Show sneak cones\" key) will cycle the bar above it. Action Buttons The buttons in the bottom left part of the hotbar have been revamped, and are now customizable. In addition to them being re-arrangable by drag-and-dropping (if the hotbar is unlocked) , mods can add their own \"action buttons\" there with custom functionality*. Right-click these buttons (or click the button with the ^ arrows) to open the \"actions drawer\", where you can see all the actions that you can drag-and-drop to assign them to the buttons at the bottom. You may also click them in the drawer to use them. To assign keyboard hotkeys to these, go to the controls settings menu and assign the \"Hotbar Custom Hotkey\" keys. These buttons are shared across all your characters; you only need to bind them once, and then can enjoy their convenience from any character. Several new \"actions\" are implemented: Resting : uses a bedroll from the party inventory. No longer do you need to place one on your hotbar nor even have one per character! Pyramids : opens the Teleporter Pyramid UI. Again, reduces hotbar clutter and saves time spent looking through your inventory to find out where the heck these are. Chain/unchain : chains/unchains your active character with others nearby instantly. Waypoints : opens the fast travel menu. Ping : shortcut to the ping function. Chat/Combat Log : toggle the respective UIs. The original char button has been yeeted. Additionally, as a compatibility consideration for older mods, you can drag any skill or item from the hotbar to these buttons to bind them there. This is useful for mods that implement menus through skills or usable items (ex. LL's older mods). *Documentation pending completion; if someone wants to start making custom buttons with these already let me know; the API won't change. Compatibility Incompatible with mods that modify hotBar.swf . This might be worked around in the future if it becomes a concern. Arena mode and GM mode are untested. Consider them unsupported! Also note that the mod automatically unbinds some GM keybindings that are used for the customizable buttons the first time you install it (since they clash with some regular game hotkeys). Compatibility considerations: Weapon Expansion: added an action to open the menu, shifted it slightly up (so the close button is accessible with 2 bars), repositioned the button when you have 2 rows of customizable buttons Portable Respec Mirror (Fort Joy Edition): added an action to use the mirror Epic Encounters 2: the original actions remain (Source Infuse, Meditate) Known issues On lower resolutions, a piece of art from the right-most edge might \"clip\" into the slots area Some art is ugly/unfinished Upon making new profiles, the keybindings used for the customizable buttons aren't reset - check them if your keys start doing weird stuff in a new game! Items slotted into the customizable buttons don't display proper names Skills slotted into the customizable buttons don't grey out properly, ex. if you don't meet their requirements (doesn't affect their use) The console log is spammed during session reloads Minor incompatibilities with LeaderLib: Hotkey keybinds don't show on the customizable buttons My custom settings menu is broken (I've excluded it entirely from the mod for now, would like to have some settings for the hotbar though; will look into it later)","title":"Standalone Hotbar Mod"},{"location":"hotbar-standalone/#standalone-hotbar-mod","text":"The Improved Hotbar mod allows you to have multiple bars at once (up to 5), and adds new functionality to improve the hotbar experience further.

Chain/unchain : chains/unchains your active character with others nearby instantly. Waypoints : opens the fast travel menu. Ping : shortcut to the ping function. Chat/Combat Log : toggle the respective UIs. The original char button has been yeeted. Additionally, as a compatibility consideration for older mods, you can drag any skill or item from the hotbar to these buttons to bind them there. This is useful for mods that implement menus through skills or usable items (ex. LL's older mods). *Documentation pending completion; if someone wants to start making custom buttons with these already let me know; the API won't change.","title":"Action Buttons"},{"location":"hotbar-standalone/#compatibility","text":"Incompatible with mods that modify hotBar.swf .

Also note that the mod automatically unbinds some GM keybindings that are used for the customizable buttons the first time you install it (since they clash with some regular game hotkeys). Compatibility considerations: Weapon Expansion: added an action to open the menu, shifted it slightly up (so the close button is accessible with 2 bars), repositioned the button when you have 2 rows of customizable buttons Portable Respec Mirror (Fort Joy Edition): added an action to use the mirror Epic Encounters 2: the original actions remain (Source Infuse, Meditate)","title":"Compatibility"},{"location":"hotbar-standalone/#known-issues","text":"On lower resolutions, a piece of art from the right-most edge might \"clip\" into the slots area Some art is ugly/unfinished Upon making new profiles, the keybindings used for the customizable buttons aren't reset - check them if your keys start doing weird stuff in a new game!

To get it, create a file named OsiUpdateChannel.txt in the same directory where you installed the extender (where DXGI.dll is) with the contents: Devel Download here . (19/2/22) 19/2/22 Huge Hotbar rewrite Rewrote the hotbar UI. This involves mostly technical changes, in preparations for a standalone release. Your hotkey keybindings will be reset with this update! Please bind them again. Visible changes: Fixed the top of the buttons area blocking clicks onto the world and other UIs Any skill or item can now be dragged from the hotbar to the customizable buttons to bind it there (useful for old mods that use skills/items to bring up menus) The \"use last slot\" action has been removed due to this. Removed the \"view changelog\" action The slot rendering is now entirely scripted (no help from the engine) which works around a crash and removes the need for an initialization procedure (that annoying \"switch to the first row\" message) Saving your current amount of bars and order should be a lot more reliable (now happens upon pausing the game, instead of a timer) Action buttons can now be highlighted or disabled; ex. the pyramids one is disabled if the party has no pyramids Added an action to open the pyramids UI Fixed the source skill border clipping into other rows Added compatibility for Weapon Expansion: adds an action for toggling the menu, and repositions the original button when you have 2 rows of action buttons Actions in the drawer are now ordered in a consistent manner Added a context menu when you right click a row; from there, you can: \"Push\" groups of slots to the left/right (useful for inserting skills inbetween slots) Clear rows, or unmemorized skills Save and load \"loadouts\" of rows. Loadouts can be applied even if your character doesn't currently know all the skills from it. Other changes: Simple tooltips (the ones that go in that very small black box) now appear much faster, rather than being delayed Added numerous calls to Game.Character and Game.Item , mostly related to functionality needed for the hotbar. 5/2/22 Docs inauguration patch :flashed: Added new stats to the stats tab (more coming later): Party gold, splinters Celestial restoration Vitality Void damage, radius Prosperity threshold Rewrote the ingame options menu; the mod's settings now gets its own tab instead of being stuffed into Gameplay You can now switch to and from Tactician difficulty at any time from settings Improved context menu scrolling Touchups to MessageBox, Examine Cleaned up Utilities.lua, removed old unused methods Removed support for the archaic config file structure (from before the ingame settings menu; very old) Created documentation for Game , OptionsSettings, MessageBox, StatsTab, Examine, and CharacterSheet 26/1/22: birthday patch :flashed: Fixed \u201cTeleport to\u201d not working on anything other than characters; it now works with items and triggers as well Fixed shields not showing all transmog options Fixed more inconsistency issues with context menus on world characters Transmog menu now works properly for characters that have had their race/gender changed Added an option to show B/H next to player portraits while unsheathed Fixed tooltips of damaging statuses for real Added an option to force story patching on every load Physical/pierce resistances in character sheet now get colored blue/red like how the normal resistances would Holding shift now fades out statuses on the enemy health bar Temporary solution for scrolling context menus that would leave the screen, with the mouse wheel Added something awesome to Fort Joy Technical stuff so it doesn\u2019t look like I\u2019m doing nothing: Added utility methods for initializing \u201cFeatures\u201d You can now specify required filesystem overrides and mods for features, with them automatically disabling themselves if these are missing Removed GetCharacterDodge function Rewrote character sheet resistances script Rewrote script for enemy health bar Moved Majora\u2019s compatibility to its own script Added Game.Character library for character-related stuff Moved a lot of old calls to Client Started work on a library that allows the creation of UIs purely in lua (no swf/actionscript editing) 14/1/22: Re-enabled custom icons on the UIs that previously used them, as the extender issues with them have been fixed. Added a transmog context menu, can be enabled in settings. Appears on equipment with visuals, including weapons. Submenus display categorized root templates, filtered down to only the ones compatible with your current race/gender/alive/undead. Supports Majora\u2019s Fashion Sins. Can save/load outfits, along with their dyes. Saved outfits are in EPIP_VanityOutfits.json Warning: artifacts and armor set items will not currently work properly when transmogrified. Also, Majora\u2019s tabs tend to overflow the screen. Fixed status tooltips in v56 Fixed extract runes context menu option consuming gold instead of splinters Numerous miscellaneous internal changes 27/12/21: Updated to v56 of the extender. Current issues (with the extender): Anything related to status tooltip editing does not work as Game.Tooltip is borked UIs with custom icons (hotbar, toolip) stop displaying vanilla icons after the first session. Custom icons are disabled for now so as to keep both the hotbar and console usable Removed the old console cheats Full rewrite of the stats tab; it should be a lot more reliable now (especially in multiplayer) and survives lua resets Stats and categories are now defined in Epip.Features.StatsTab. Fixed context menu not working on chained characters, and added it to summon portraits (maybe) fixed summon portrait display issues Custom talents now display in the examine menu Organizational changes to tooltip adjustments script torturerSkillOverrides was moved to Data.Game.TORTURER_SKILL_OVERRIDES statusToSkill was moved to Data.Game.DAMAGING_STATUS_SKILLS v1043 (19/12/21) Added critical chance to the examine menu, below damage Added an option to set the default position of the Examine menu (middle, left, or right of the screen) Fixed health bar appearing in character creation Added a new context menu option to dismantle all equipment within a container. Only shows up when there's equipment within a container. Dismantling through the context menu now requires shift-clicking for any equipped item Fixed right-clicking containers bringing up debugging cheats for the character you previously had selected Organizational changes to various UI scripts and older features, as preparations for the grand debut of the Epip modding docs Reuploaded on 22/12/21 with the following fixes: More organizational changes (moving Data.UI to Client.UI.Data) Fixed immunities in examine showing up in the wrong place Undid some recent changes that lead to playerInfo summon display breaking Reuploaded on 23/12/21 to remove some testing text in character creation, as well as to (maybe?) fix an issue with combat HUD disappearing in new games. v1042 (14/12/21) Added an option to hide hotbar hotkeys text Added an \"Immersive Meditation\" setting which disables hotbar and minimap UIs while in Amer UIs Added shortened names for the remaining numpad keys (multiply, add, minus, etc.) Added an auto-identify setting, with 2 modes: always, and only with enough Loremaster. This will instantly identify items when they are generated Item tooltips no longer overflow through the top of the screen, making it easier to see the damage stats on items with 3 filled sockets Dismantling from the context menu now requires shift-clicking for items with runes inside (as a way to mark them as 'important' and avoid misclicks related to a certain new feature) Added a context menu option to items to dye them (requires the dyes to be in the party's inventory) Added a context menu to player portraits to hide statuses and summons (not saved between reloads for now) Added a context menu option to extract runes from items Added a debug menu with cheats for characters, available in the extender's developer mode Accessed by right-clicking a character in the world, or a player portrait in the left portraits UI Allows you to add all sorts of stats, spells, SpecialLogic, spawn items, treasure tables, toggle godmode, and more The new context menu tech is quite extensive, and can be toggled off in the settings in case any serious issues arise Finesse recovery now works for pay X skills, and sucker punch You can add more exceptions to DB_PIP_WeaponBasedFinesse_Whitelist((STRING)_Skill) Fixed overhead dialogue durations being wrong when they were changed away from the default value Overhead sizes are now always default in Amer UIs Fixed origins gaining epic enemies perks for real this time Fixed description of Clouded Memory Fixed map visibility setting not working after exiting respec Fixed being able to toggle minimap within character creation Fixed weapon range deltamod tooltip showing up on unidentified items Fixed wrong health bar B/H display on dead characters The dismantle context menu option should no longer get permanently stuck in case of unidentified shenanigans Added a 20% tax to dismantling items from context menus, used to amortize the development costs of the new menus as well as to fund future development of the mod just kidding v1041 (23/10/21) Added a slider for status overhead duration Fixed damage overheads for items not working with the new size settings Fixed the talents tab being selected after exiting mirror Fixed character sheet not updating the first time it is opened after a respec Fixed decimal stat adjustments being lost while merging them into one tooltip Fixed character creation talent points display when changing presets Fixed 1st hotbar not being clickable after a lua reset Fixed hotbar cooldown/active overlays when joining mid-session This should also have fixed the issue with loading a save during a summon turn Origins should no longer get Epic Enemies buffs Possibly fixed unidentified items showing the weapon range deltamods in the tooltip v1040 (19/10/21) Added some client APIs for the message box UI and overhead texts (Client.UI.MessageBox and Client.UI.Overheads) Added settings for overhead sizes Added a setting to bring back the vanilla combat log button (on by default) Fixed talents not being hidden properly in the character creation UI (which includes the mirror, it's the same UI) Fixed EE stats tab not working for new companions until a reload Fixed sliders in the options menu being saved with +1 step than what you've set them to v1039 (17/10/21) Fixed SI tooltip highlighting not working for a few schools Fixed wrong earth damage color in shift-tooltips v1038 (16/10/21) Added a hotbar hotkey to use the skill/item on the very last slot of your hotbar (right-most in 5th row) Can use this to make a Source Vamp hotkey, for example Weapon range deltamods now show up like regular deltamods on the tooltip, and the weapon range display is split up to show both base and extra range Holding the show cones button (shift by default) will display skill damage as their multipliers When infusing or when the shift key is held, unmet SI requirements will be displayed in red text Possibly fixed the \"auto-unlock inventories\" feature Artifact items now show quality Added an option to log all UI ExternalInterface calls and invokes to the console, visible in the settings menu if the extender developer mode is enabled Started slowly organizing code into sensical libraries; anything in the extended Game table should be reliable and will likely not change names Let me know if something that used to work before broke all of a sudden Fixed an error in the console when hovering over armor whose subtype could not be determined (ex. the starting tattered equipment) Character Creation UI now implements machine learning and blockchain technology to notify you of possible typos in your character names Added a WIP custom talents feature. See EpipTalents.lua for usage example. You can also hide any non-racial talent. Shortcomings: They will only display on kb+m. No controller UI support yet. They do not show up in the examine UI yet. Requirements are not rechecked while moving ability/attribute points around in the mirror; upon exiting, you will still lose any talents you cannot sustain Can't bind them to deltamods Rarely, the mirror UI might show you having fewer talent points than you do - this should fix itself if you exit the mirror and go back in (if someone has a save where this happens consistently, let me know) As a result of the talent UI changes, the bug with unequipping walk-it-off should be fixed v1037 (2/10/21) Fixed right-most zeros getting culled in stat adjustment tooltips Added a new setting to disable fog of war (server-wide, host-only, non-destructive; can be reverted) Minor visual bug: re-enabling FoW will cause the world to go black until you unpause v1036 (1/10/21) Changed the Damage tooltip in character sheet to be less confusing Removed the obsolete \"From LW: -0%\" tooltip text from character sheet Removed the word \"Set:\" from deltamods Added an option to auto-unlock inventories in multiplayer upon loading a save. This setting is per player. Fixed negative stat adjustments not being grouped together in tooltips Equipment now shows a \"Quality\" rating in tooltips, which denotes how good its damage/armor roll was. An item with 100% Quality has the best roll (only possible for Divines) Trickster's Repertoire now grants invisibility+sneaking until the start of your first turn, and only causes you to sneak starting from your second round. Additionally, at the start of your turns, you always unsneak. Changed wording for the Hothead tooltip Fixed error spam in console upon reload, and reorganized some code Added a lifesteal stat to the stats tab (will update upon changing Necromancy points, or in combat) Finished support for preset descriptions in character creation, override CharacterCreation.characterCreationPresetDescriptions in CharacterCreationUI.lua to set them v1035 (12/09/21) Replaced the config json file with an ingame settings menu, available from the game's normal \"Gameplay settings\" tab Unidentified artifacts now show their rarity as artifact, and use the custom color Proteans and Artifact runes now also use the Artifact color, and slots that they cannot be put on have a warning message Fixed Trickster's Repertoire breaking sneaking from other effects that cause you to sneak Fixed hotbar initialization message (again) v1032 (05/09/21) Small patch with some QoL for dyes and a fix for a Finesse issue. Dyeing equipped items will now re-quip them automatically Changed the finesse recovery for weapon-based skills to fix an issue with delayed procs if multiple things used its logic Removed the option to show enemy lvl in healthbar (still buggy!) v1030 (30/08/21) Monthly patch to appease our ever-so-hungry Derpy overlord. Hotbar slot keys now work as expected - ex. pressing \"4\" will use the fourth skill on the bottom bar, regardless of the row it's set to Hotbar actions now show their keybinding, if they have one Vanilla actions (ex. open journal) will always show the vanilla keybind instead of the custom one (it will still work, though) Re-enabled the keyboard hotkeys for hotbar actions by default. If you had these disabled previously (or if you're using the mod for the first time), its keys will be unbound upon loading in Changed the default hotbar bindings to swap ping with combat log Added a hotbar action for Portable Respec Mirror, if its mod is loaded Resting from the hotbar now uses the item rather than resting directly (should work with other bedroll mods now) Added a toggle for the minimap onto the hotbar You can no longer rearrange hotbar actions while the hotbar is locked (except within the skills panel) Added a faint blinking animation to the health bar when B/H have 1 turn or less remaining Added an option to show level next to character name in the top healthbar (on by default) You can now unbind hotbar action buttons with middle-click Added handling for when hotbar actions are removed from a save (ex. disabling a mod that adds them) Brittle status now shows its calculated damage like DoTs Masterworked items now show a warning in the tooltip Changed Splintered Arrow icon Fixed Escapist being a huntsman skill Fix protruding hotbar texture on the bottom bar Fixed Trickster's Repertoire removing AP in consecutive turns Trickster's Repertoire no longer activates while playing dead Fixed artifact names not using the new color (oops) Moved the casting notification slightly up so multiline ones don't overlap the health bar Fixed dragging items onto the world not working if the hotbar was enabled Fixed the add/remove rows button being available on summons after opening the pause menu You can no longer use hotbar action hotkeys in dialogues (or other occasions where the UI is entirely hidden), when there is a UI element focused, or when the game is paused Fixed name of hotbar slot 6 binding in the input menu Fixed Slowed 3 AP penalty stacking v1029 (06/08/21) Moved the casting notifications to where your health bar is, and added a toggle for them in the settings (defaults to enabled) Toggle party link hotbar hotkey is now instant (no casting animation) Added a one-row layout to the hotbar actions bar, which is automatically used when you only have one row of skill slots active You can control the behaviour with the new hotbarHotkeysLayout setting: \"auto\" is the behaviour described above, \"single\" makes it always use the 1-row layout, \"dual\" forces it to always be two rows (like how it was before) Keyboard hotkeys remain functional at all times, even if the buttons are hidden Fixed \"c\" displaying on the hotbar button you're dragging DoT statuses now show their calculated damage The display fluctuates for a bit after a skill cast, might redo this entirely later to not rely on the engine damage formula Centurion Battlestomp can now only be cast if the target is at <10m, and does not consume the ranged charge Tried banishing the \"Enemy Turn\" message again v1027, v1028 (30/07/21 and 31/07/21) This patch contains numerous fixes and the first part of the rework of hotbar hotkeys. Happy birthday Derpy! Replaced the tutorials tab in the journal with a patch notes tab See EpipPatchNotes.lua for an example on how to use this in your own mod. Artifact tooltips now show \"Artifact\" as rarity rather than Unique Hotbar Updates Added customizable hotbar action hotkeys/buttons. Drag and drop to rearrange/assign them, right click to bring up a list of all actions. Mods can add their own actions very easily; see HotbarActions.lua for an example. To use them with keyboard keys, assign the \"Hotbar Hotkey #\" keys from the game's controls menu. Rebinding them will be easier in the future. You must also enable them within the config file. This rework is a work-in-progress, both in terms of functionality and art; in the future there will also be a 1-row layout. The multihotbar is now enabled by default. Set \"disableHotbar\" to true in the config file to disable it. (the old setting now does nothing) Deprecated the Infusion and Meditate hotkeys; please use the hotbar version of them from now on. Summons can no longer add hotbar rows All the custom elements should now hide during dialogues Fixed jankiness when using low resolutions Fixes Fixed player status bar sometimes clipping through portraits and appearing to the left of them Fixed stat adjustments tooltip not working properly on resists Fixed stat adjustments tooltip eating up all other boosts Fixed boss frame in the enemy health bar UI. It should work consistently now Leper rune now should properly grant the talent when it's socketed into an equipped item Fixed being able to infuse out-of-turn with the hotkey (rest in peace gigabrain infused reaction builds) Possibly disabled turn notifications on the hotbar health bar Known issues \"Actions\" drawer (attack/sneak/sheathe) does not work well along with the default keyboard hotkey, and the menu is not repositioned Buttons on the hotbar don't yet light up like they do in vanilla Order of actions in drawer is random Some hotbar buttons do not have state animations yet The title in the patch notes menu will not be the right color the first time after a reload Earlier changelogs are available on the old google doc.

Extended to allow for custom setting tabs. Note that the input menu is a different UI - documentation for it pending. Adding settings To create a tab with settings for your mod, start by calling RegisterMod(mod: string, data: OptionsSettingsOptionSet) , before SessionLoading - preferably in the lua script's body. The data table should have your mod's name, header (displayed at the top) and side button label (displayed on the button that switches tabs). You may also pass Options in the table at this time, or register settings later through RegisterOptions . Client.UI.OptionsSettings.RegisterMod(\"EpipEncounters\", { SideButtonLabel = \"Epip Encounters\", TabHeader = \"<font color='7e72d6' size='23'>Epip Encounters</font>\", }) Options is a list of the options for the settings tab, in order that they will appear in. They are in the OptionsSettingsOption format - see fields . The following types of options exist: Checkbox : OptionsSettingsCheckbox struct Dropdown : OptionsSettingsDropdown struct Slider : OptionsSettingsSlider struct Button : OptionsSettingsButton struct Header : OptionsSettingsHeader struct, just a text label. Good for dividing sections of your setting menu. Example options, a dropdown and a slider: { ID = \"ExaminePosition\", Type = \"Dropdown\", Label = \"Examine Menu Position\", Tooltip = \"Controls the default position of the Examine menu when it is opened.\", DefaultValue = 1, Options = { \"Center\", \"Middle Right\", \"Middle Left\" } }, { ID = \"OverheadsSize\", Type = \"Slider\", Label = \"Overhead Text Size\", MinAmount = 10, MaxAmount = 45, DefaultValue = 19, Interval = 1, HideNumbers = false, Tooltip = \"Controls the size of regular text above characters talking.<br><br>Default is 19.\", }, Once you've got your mod and settings registered, they will appear in the settings menu. The user will be able to change them, and their values will be stored to the disk. To query the value of a setting, use GetOptionValue(mod: string, setting: string) . For checkboxes this returns boolean , for other elements it's number . Dropdowns use 1-based indexing! (1 = first option) . You can also set the stored value (or hook GetOptionValue ). If you do this, keep in mind that it will not be automatically saved to disk. if (Minimap.visible ~= Client.UI.OptionsSettings.GetOptionValue(\"EpipEncounters\", \"Minimap\")) then Client.UI.OptionsSettings.SetOptionValue(\"EpipEncounters\", \"Minimap\", Minimap.visible) Client.UI.OptionsSettings.SaveSettings() end You may use the IsElementEnabled hook to make elements in your menu non-interactable.

The data table should have your mod's name, header (displayed at the top) and side button label (displayed on the button that switches tabs). You may also pass Options in the table at this time, or register settings later through RegisterOptions . Client.UI.OptionsSettings.RegisterMod(\"EpipEncounters\", { SideButtonLabel = \"Epip Encounters\", TabHeader = \"<font color='7e72d6' size='23'>Epip Encounters</font>\", }) Options is a list of the options for the settings tab, in order that they will appear in. They are in the OptionsSettingsOption format - see fields . The following types of options exist: Checkbox : OptionsSettingsCheckbox struct Dropdown : OptionsSettingsDropdown struct Slider : OptionsSettingsSlider struct Button : OptionsSettingsButton struct Header : OptionsSettingsHeader struct, just a text label. Good for dividing sections of your setting menu. Example options, a dropdown and a slider: { ID = \"ExaminePosition\", Type = \"Dropdown\", Label = \"Examine Menu Position\", Tooltip = \"Controls the default position of the Examine menu when it is opened.\", DefaultValue = 1, Options = { \"Center\", \"Middle Right\", \"Middle Left\" } }, { ID = \"OverheadsSize\", Type = \"Slider\", Label = \"Overhead Text Size\", MinAmount = 10, MaxAmount = 45, DefaultValue = 19, Interval = 1, HideNumbers = false, Tooltip = \"Controls the size of regular text above characters talking.<br><br>Default is 19.\", }, Once you've got your mod and settings registered, they will appear in the settings menu. The user will be able to change them, and their values will be stored to the disk. To query the value of a setting, use GetOptionValue(mod: string, setting: string) . For checkboxes this returns boolean , for other elements it's number . Dropdowns use 1-based indexing! (1 = first option) . You can also set the stored value (or hook GetOptionValue ). If you do this, keep in mind that it will not be automatically saved to disk. if (Minimap.visible ~= Client.UI.OptionsSettings.GetOptionValue(\"EpipEncounters\", \"Minimap\")) then Client.UI.OptionsSettings.SetOptionValue(\"EpipEncounters\", \"Minimap\", Minimap.visible) Client.UI.OptionsSettings.SaveSettings() end You may use the IsElementEnabled hook to make elements in your menu non-interactable.

Is this decoupling overengineered? Possibly, but it's a good showcase of how easily extensible systems can be if you stuff them with events. TODO document the rest of the system - Only Shared.lua is here atm. Creating Stats There's 3 steps to creating a stat. Steps 1 and 2 have to be done on both contexts. Define the stat; it's name, tooltip, how it displays, etc. Put it into a category (or create one for it) Set/update it's value when requested, through RegisterStatValueHook You can define a stat with RegisterStat(id: string, data: EpipStat) . The structure of a stat is the following: ---@class EpipStat ---@field Name string ---@field Description string Fallback description in case a formatted Tooltip isn't set. ---@field Tooltip TooltipData ---@field Footnote string Italic text after description, in new paragraph. ---@field Suffix string Suffix for value display. ---@field Prefix string Prefix for value display. ---@field Boolean boolean Boolean stats show no value label. ---@field MaxCharges string If specified, this stat will display as \"{Value}/{Value of MaxCharges stat}\" ---@field IgnoreForHiding boolean If true, this stat will not be considered as added when determining if a Hidden category should display. StatsTab.RegisterStat(\"RegenLifeCalculated\", { Name = \"Missing Life Regen\", Description = \"Restores a percentage of your missing Vitality at the start of your turn.\", Footnote = \"Missing Regeneration is capped at 50%.\", Suffix = \"%\", }) Next, you need to append it into a category with AddStatToCategory(statID: string, categoryID: string, index?: integer) . You can omit index and it will be placed at the bottom. StatsTab.AddStatToCategory(\"RegenLifeCalculated\", \"Vitals\") Finally, you need to register a hook to update the stat's value. This can be done in 2 ways: on client or on server (do not do both). If the stat's value can be queried from the client context, you only need a simple hook on the client: StatsTab.RegisterStatValueHook(\"PartyFunds_Gold\", function(value, data, char) return Game.Items.GetPartyTemplateCount(\"LOOT_Gold_A_1c3c9c74-34a1-4685-989e-410dc080be6f\") end) For stats that require info from the server, there is a special system in place that synchronizes stat values with tags. To set a stat's value from the server context, you need to use a different event (note it's not a hook, you must call UpdateTaggedStat yourself). On the client, the stat's value will be queried automatically from such tag if it is set; the advantage here being that there is no need to request stats from the server every time the tab is opened. StatsTab.RegisterStatUpdateListener(\"Keyword_VitalityVoid_Power\", function(char, data) Osi.QRY_AMER_KeywordStat_VitalityVoid_GetPower(char.MyGuid, 1) local value = Osi.DB_AMER_KeywordStat_OUTPUT_Real:Get(nil)[1][1] * 100 EpipStats.UpdateTaggedStat(char, \"Keyword_VitalityVoid_Power\", value) end) Creating Ascension Node Stats Stats related to Ascension nodes are automatically updated if their ID follows a specific format. All you need to do is define one; no further event listeners required. It will also be automatically put into the relevant keyword's category. You can create such stat with StatsTab.AddNodeStat(clusterId: string, nodeIndex: number, nodeSubIndex: number, keyword: Keyword, keywordType: KeywordBoonType, statData: EpipStat) . StatData is the stat definition, like with a normal stat. The indexes are 0-based. ClusterId is the ID of the Aspect, ex. Force_TheFalcon . There's just one small catch: owned nodes are only tracked if there's a stat defined for them. When you add stats in an update, you should call StatsTab.RecalculateNodeStats() on the server during the patch routine. You can also call NRD_ModCall(\"EpipEncounters\", \"PerformFullStatsUpdate\"); from Osiris, but this will be removed in the future. Creating Categories A category holds stats, and can be collapsed in the menu. Stats only render if they're within a category that is open. They can be added with RegisterCategory(id: string, data: EpipStatCategory, index?: integer) . See the EpipStatCategory struct. StatsTab.RegisterCategory(\"Vitals\", { Header = \"<font size='21'>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Vitals \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</font>\", Name = \"Vitals\", Behaviour = \"GreyOut\", Stats = { \"RegenLifeCalculated\", \"RegenPhysicalArmorCalculated\", \"RegenMagicArmorCalculated\", \"LifeSteal\", }, }) Modifying Stats Stat definitions are stored in StatsTab.STATS .
